NAME="SERVER-START"
>17.3. Starting the Database Server</A
></H1
><P
>   Before anyone can access the database, you must start the database
   server. The database server program is called
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postgres</TT
>.
   The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postgres</TT
> program must know where to
   find the data it is supposed to use. This is done with the
   <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-D</TT
> option. Thus, the simplest way to start the
   server is:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>$ <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</KBD
></PRE
><P>
   which will leave the server running in the foreground. This must be
   done while logged into the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> user
   account. Without <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-D</TT
>, the server will try to use
   the data directory named by the environment variable <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGDATA</TT
>.
   If that variable is not provided either, it will fail.
  </P
><P
>   Normally it is better to start <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postgres</TT
> in the
   background.  For this, use the usual Unix shell syntax:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>$ <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data &gt;logfile 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</KBD
></PRE
><P>
   It is important to store the server's <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>stdout</SPAN
> and
   <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>stderr</SPAN
> output somewhere, as shown above. It will help
   for auditing purposes and to diagnose problems. (See <A
HREF="logfile-maintenance.html"
>Section 23.3</A
> for a more thorough discussion of log
   file handling.)
  </P
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postgres</TT
> program also takes a number of other
   command-line options. For more information, see the
   <A
HREF="app-postgres.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>postgres</SPAN
></A
> reference page
   and <A
HREF="runtime-config.html"
>Chapter 18</A
> below.
  </P
><P
>   This shell syntax can get tedious quickly.  Therefore the wrapper
   program
   <A
HREF="app-pg-ctl.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_ctl</SPAN
></A
>
   is provided to simplify some tasks.  For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>pg_ctl start -l logfile</PRE
><P>
   will start the server in the background and put the output into the
   named log file. The <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-D</TT
> option has the same meaning
   here as for <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postgres</TT
>. <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pg_ctl</TT
>
   is also capable of stopping the server.
  </P
><P
>   Normally, you will want to start the database server when the
   computer boots. Autostart scripts are operating-system-specific.
   There are a few distributed with
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> in the
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib/start-scripts</TT
> directory. Installing one will require
   root privileges.
  </P
><P
>   Different systems have different conventions for starting up daemons
   at boot time. Many systems have a file
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/rc.local</TT
> or
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</TT
>. Others use
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rc.d</TT
> directories. Whatever you do, the server must be
   run by the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> user account
   <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>and not by root</I
></SPAN
> or any other user. Therefore you
   probably should form your commands using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>su -c '...'
   postgres</TT
>.  For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>su -c 'pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l serverlog' postgres</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   Here are a few more operating-system-specific suggestions. (In each
   case be sure to use the proper installation directory and user
   name where we show generic values.)

     start. Check the server's log file, or start it by hand (without

>LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Address already in use
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 5432? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
FATAL:  could not create TCP/IP listen socket</PRE
><P>
     This usually means just what it suggests: you tried to start
     another server on the same port where one is already running.
     However, if the kernel error message is not <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>Address
     already in use</SAMP
> or some variant of that, there might
     be a different problem. For example, trying to start a server
     on a reserved port number might draw something like:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>$ <KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>postgres -p 666</KBD
>
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Permission denied
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 666? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.

DETAIL:  Failed system call was shmget(key=5440001, size=4011376640, 03600).</PRE
><P>
     probably means your kernel's limit on the size of shared memory is
     smaller than the work area <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
     is trying to create (4011376640 bytes in this example). Or it could
     mean that you do not have System-V-style shared memory support
     configured into your kernel at all. As a temporary workaround, you
     can try starting the server with a smaller-than-normal number of
     buffers (<A
HREF="runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS"
>shared_buffers</A
>). You will eventually want
     to reconfigure your kernel to increase the allowed shared memory
     size. You might also see this message when trying to start multiple
     servers on the same machine, if their total space requested
     exceeds the kernel limit.
    </P

     you might be able to work around the problem by starting the
     server with a reduced number of allowed connections
     (<A
HREF="runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS"
>max_connections</A
>), but you'll eventually want to
     increase the kernel limit.
    </P
><P
>     If you get an <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

     shared memory or semaphores are not supported in your kernel at
     all. In that case your only option is to reconfigure the kernel to
     enable these features.

     This is the generic <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    </P

>     The last line is useful in verifying that the client is trying to

     <SAMP

     does <SPAN

     connection request and rejected it. That case will produce a
     different message, as shown in <A

>Section 19.4</A
>.) Other error messages
     such as <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>Connection timed out</SAMP

     indicate more fundamental problems, like lack of network
