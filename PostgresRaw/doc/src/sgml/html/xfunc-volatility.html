NAME="XFUNC-VOLATILITY"
>35.6. Function Volatility Categories</A
></H1
><P
>    Every function has a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>volatility</I
> classification, with
    the possibilities being <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VOLATILE</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STABLE</TT
>, or
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IMMUTABLE</TT
>.  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VOLATILE</TT
> is the default if the
    <A
HREF="sql-createfunction.html"
>CREATE FUNCTION</A
>
    command does not specify a category.  The volatility category is a
    promise to the optimizer about the behavior of the function:

   <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>      A <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VOLATILE</TT
> function can do anything, including modifying
      the database.  It can return different results on successive calls with
      the same arguments.  The optimizer makes no assumptions about the
      behavior of such functions.  A query using a volatile function will
      re-evaluate the function at every row where its value is needed.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      A <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STABLE</TT
> function cannot modify the database and is
      guaranteed to return the same results given the same arguments
      for all rows within a single statement. This category allows the
      optimizer to optimize multiple calls of the function to a single
      call. In particular, it is safe to use an expression containing
      such a function in an index scan condition. (Since an index scan
      will evaluate the comparison value only once, not once at each
      row, it is not valid to use a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VOLATILE</TT
> function in an
      index scan condition.)
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      An <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IMMUTABLE</TT
> function cannot modify the database and is
      guaranteed to return the same results given the same arguments forever.
      This category allows the optimizer to pre-evaluate the function when
      a query calls it with constant arguments.  For example, a query like
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT ... WHERE x = 2 + 2</TT
> can be simplified on sight to
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT ... WHERE x = 4</TT
>, because the function underlying
      the integer addition operator is marked <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IMMUTABLE</TT
>.
     </P
></LI
></UL
><P>
   </P
><P
>    For best optimization results, you should label your functions with the
    strictest volatility category that is valid for them.
   </P
><P
>    Any function with side-effects <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>must</I
></SPAN
> be labeled
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VOLATILE</TT
>, so that calls to it cannot be optimized away.
    Even a function with no side-effects needs to be labeled
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VOLATILE</TT
> if its value can change within a single query;
    some examples are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>random()</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>currval()</TT
>,
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>timeofday()</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    Another important example is that the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>current_timestamp</CODE
>
    family of functions qualify as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STABLE</TT
>, since their values do
    not change within a transaction.
   </P
><P
>    There is relatively little difference between <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STABLE</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IMMUTABLE</TT
> categories when considering simple interactive
    queries that are planned and immediately executed: it doesn't matter
    a lot whether a function is executed once during planning or once during
    query execution startup.  But there is a big difference if the plan is
    saved and reused later.  Labeling a function <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IMMUTABLE</TT
> when
    it really isn't might allow it to be prematurely folded to a constant during
    planning, resulting in a stale value being re-used during subsequent uses
    of the plan.  This is a hazard when using prepared statements or when
    using function languages that cache plans (such as
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
>).
   </P
><P
>    For functions written in SQL or in any of the standard procedural
    languages, there is a second important property determined by the
    volatility category, namely the visibility of any data changes that have
    been made by the SQL command that is calling the function.  A
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VOLATILE</TT
> function will see such changes, a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STABLE</TT
>
    or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IMMUTABLE</TT
> function will not.  This behavior is implemented
    using the snapshotting behavior of MVCC (see <A
HREF="mvcc.html"
>Chapter 13</A
>):
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STABLE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IMMUTABLE</TT
> functions use a snapshot
    established as of the start of the calling query, whereas
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VOLATILE</TT
> functions obtain a fresh snapshot at the start of
    each query they execute.

    from database tables within an <TT

    since the immutability will be broken if the table contents ever change.

   </P
><P
>    A common error is to label a function <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IMMUTABLE</TT
> when its
    results depend on a configuration parameter.  For example, a function
    that manipulates timestamps might well have results that depend on the
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-TIMEZONE"
>timezone</A
> setting.  For safety, such functions should
    be labeled <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>STABLE</TT

     the database was not enforced by the system.  Releases 8.0 and later enforce it
     by requiring SQL functions and procedural language functions of these
     categories to contain no SQL commands other than <TT

     (This is not a completely bulletproof test, since such functions could
     still call <TT

     If you do that, you will find that the <TT
