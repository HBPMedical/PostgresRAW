    plan</I

    plan to match the query structure and the properties of the data
    is absolutely critical for good performance, so the system includes
    a complex <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"

    You can use the
    <A
HREF="sql-explain.html"
>EXPLAIN</A

    to see what query plan the planner creates for any query.
    Plan-reading is an art that deserves an extensive tutorial, which
    this is not; but here is some basic information.
   </P
><P
>    The structure of a query plan is a tree of <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>plan nodes</I
>.
    Nodes at the bottom level of the tree are table scan nodes: they return raw rows
    from a table.  There are different types of scan nodes for different
    table access methods: sequential scans, index scans, and bitmap index
    scans.  If the query requires joining, aggregation, sorting, or other
    operations on the raw rows, then there will be additional nodes
    above the scan nodes to perform these operations.  Again,
    there is usually more than one possible way to do these operations,
    so different node types can appear here too.  The output
    of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXPLAIN</TT
> has one line for each node in the plan
    tree, showing the basic node type plus the cost estimates that the planner
    made for the execution of that plan node.  The first line (topmost node)
    has the estimated total execution cost for the plan; it is this number
    that the planner seeks to minimize.

    Traditional practice is to measure the costs in units of disk page

    the cost of all its child nodes.  It's also important to realize that
    the cost only reflects things that the planner cares about.
    In particular, the cost does not consider the time spent transmitting
    result rows to the client, which could be an important
    factor in the real elapsed time; but the planner ignores it because
    it cannot change it by altering the plan.  (Every correct plan will
    output the same row set, we trust.)

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

                         QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..458.00 rows=10000 width=244)</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    This is about as straightforward as it gets.  If you do:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT relpages, reltuples FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'tenk1';</PRE
><P>

    you will find that <CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"
>tenk1</CODE
> has 358 disk
    pages and 10000 rows.  The estimated cost is computed as (disk pages read *
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-query.html#GUC-SEQ-PAGE-COST"
>seq_page_cost</A
>) + (rows scanned *
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-query.html#GUC-CPU-TUPLE-COST"
>cpu_tuple_cost</A
>).  By default,
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>seq_page_cost</TT
> is 1.0 and <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>cpu_tuple_cost</TT
> is 0.01,
    so the estimated cost is (358 * 1.0) + (10000 * 0.01) = 458.
   </P
><P
>    Now let's modify the original query to add a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 7000;

                         QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..483.00 rows=7033 width=244)
   Filter: (unique1 &lt; 7000)</PRE
><P>

    Notice that the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXPLAIN</TT
> output shows the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>
    clause being applied as a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"filter"</SPAN
> condition; this means that
    the plan node checks the condition for each row it scans, and outputs
    only the ones that pass the condition.
    The estimate of output rows has been reduced because of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>
    clause.
    However, the scan will still have to visit all 10000 rows, so the cost
    hasn't decreased; in fact it has gone up a bit (by 10000 * <A
HREF="runtime-config-query.html#GUC-CPU-OPERATOR-COST"
>cpu_operator_cost</A
>, to be exact) to reflect the extra CPU
    time spent checking the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

   </P
><P
>    The actual number of rows this query would select is 7000, but the <TT

    estimate is only approximate.  If you try to duplicate this experiment,
    you will probably get a slightly different estimate; moreover, it will
    change after each <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT

    statistics produced by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT

    randomized sample of the table.
   </P
><P
>    Now, let's make the condition more restrictive:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 100;

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1  (cost=2.37..232.35 rows=106 width=244)
   Recheck Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
   -&#62;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..2.37 rows=106 width=0)
         Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)</PRE
><P>

    Here the planner has decided to use a two-step plan: the bottom plan
    node visits an index to find the locations of rows matching the index
    condition, and then the upper plan node actually fetches those rows
    from the table itself.  Fetching the rows separately is much more
    expensive than sequentially reading them, but because not all the pages
    of the table have to be visited, this is still cheaper than a sequential
    scan.  (The reason for using two plan levels is that the upper plan
    node sorts the row locations identified by the index into physical order
    before reading them, to minimize the cost of separate fetches.
    The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bitmap"</SPAN
> mentioned in the node names is the mechanism that
    does the sorting.)
   </P
><P
>    If the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition is selective enough, the planner might
    switch to a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 3;

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using tenk1_unique1 on tenk1  (cost=0.00..10.00 rows=2 width=244)
   Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 3)</PRE
><P>

    In this case the table rows are fetched in index order, which makes them
    even more expensive to read, but there are so few that the extra cost
    of sorting the row locations is not worth it.  You'll most often see
    this plan type for queries that fetch just a single row, and for queries
    that have an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> condition that matches the index
    order.
   </P
><P
>    Add another condition to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 3 AND stringu1 = 'xxx';

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using tenk1_unique1 on tenk1  (cost=0.00..10.01 rows=1 width=244)
   Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 3)
   Filter: (stringu1 = 'xxx'::name)</PRE
><P>

    The added condition <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>stringu1 = 'xxx'</TT
> reduces the
    output-rows estimate, but not the cost because we still have to visit the
    same set of rows.  Notice that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>stringu1</TT
> clause
    cannot be applied as an index condition (since this index is only on
    the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique1</TT
> column).  Instead it is applied as a filter on
    the rows retrieved by the index.  Thus the cost has actually gone up
    slightly to reflect this extra checking.
   </P
><P
>    If there are indexes on several columns referenced in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>, the
    planner might choose to use an AND or OR combination of the indexes:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 100 AND unique2 &gt; 9000;

                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1  (cost=11.27..49.11 rows=11 width=244)
   Recheck Cond: ((unique1 &lt; 100) AND (unique2 &gt; 9000))
   -&gt;  BitmapAnd  (cost=11.27..11.27 rows=11 width=0)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..2.37 rows=106 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique2  (cost=0.00..8.65 rows=1042 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique2 &gt; 9000)</PRE
><P>

    But this requires visiting both indexes, so it's not necessarily a win
    compared to using just one index and treating the other condition as
    a filter.  If you vary the ranges involved you'll see the plan change
    accordingly.
   </P
><P
>    Let's try joining two tables, using the columns we have been discussing:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM tenk1 t1, tenk2 t2
WHERE t1.unique1 &lt; 100 AND t1.unique2 = t2.unique2;

                                      QUERY PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=2.37..553.11 rows=106 width=488)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1 t1  (cost=2.37..232.35 rows=106 width=244)
         Recheck Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)

               Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using tenk2_unique2 on tenk2 t2  (cost=0.00..3.01 rows=1 width=244)
         Index Cond: (t2.unique2 = t1.unique2)</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    In this nested-loop join, the outer (upper) scan is the same bitmap index scan we
    saw earlier, and so its cost and row count are the same because we are
    applying the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique1 &lt; 100</TT
>
    at that node.
    The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t1.unique2 = t2.unique2</TT
> clause is not relevant yet,
    so it doesn't affect the row count of the outer scan.  For the inner (lower) scan, the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique2</TT

    the inner index scan to produce an index condition like
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t2.unique2 = <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>constant</I
></TT
></TT
>.
    So we get the same inner-scan plan and costs that we'd get from, say,
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk2 WHERE unique2 = 42</TT
>.  The
    costs of the loop node are then set on the basis of the cost of the outer
    scan, plus one repetition of the inner scan for each outer row (106 * 3.01,
    here), plus a little CPU time for join processing.
   </P
><P
>    In this example the join's output row count is the same as the product
    of the two scans' row counts, but that's not true in all cases because
    you can have <TT

> clauses that mention both tables
    and so can only be applied at the join point, not to either input scan.
    For example, if we added
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE ... AND t1.hundred &lt; t2.hundred</TT

    that would decrease the output row count of the join node, but not change
    either input scan.

    run time will normally be just a little larger than the total time

    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT

CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
> commands, the total run time
    might be considerably larger, because it includes the time spent processing
    the result rows.  For these commands, the time for the top plan node is
    essentially the time spent locating the old rows and/or computing
    the new ones, but it doesn't include the time spent applying the changes.
    Time spent firing triggers, if any, is also outside the top plan node,
    and is shown separately for each trigger.

>    It is worth noting that <TT

    to situations other than the one you are actually testing; for example,
    results on a toy-sized table cannot be assumed to apply to large tables.
    The planner's cost estimates are not linear and so it might choose
    a different plan for a larger or smaller table.  An extreme example
    is that on a table that only occupies one disk page, you'll nearly
    always get a sequential scan plan whether indexes are available or not.
    The planner realizes that it's going to take one disk page read to
    process the table in any case, so there's no value in expending additional
    page reads to look at an index.

      You should be able to get similar results if you try the examples yourself,
      but your estimated costs and row counts might vary slightly
      because <TT
