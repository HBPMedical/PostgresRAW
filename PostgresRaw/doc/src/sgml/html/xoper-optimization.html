     When you are defining a pair of commutative operators, things are
     a little trickier: how can the first one to be defined refer to the
     other one, which you haven't defined yet?  There are two solutions
     to this problem:

     <P

><LI
><P
>        One way is to omit the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COMMUTATOR</TT

        you define, and then provide one in the second operator's definition.
        Since <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> knows that commutative
        operators come in pairs, when it sees the second definition it will
        automatically go back and fill in the missing <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COMMUTATOR</TT
> clause in
        the first definition.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>        The other, more straightforward way is just to include <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COMMUTATOR</TT
> clauses
        in both definitions.  When <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> processes
        the first definition and realizes that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COMMUTATOR</TT
> refers to a nonexistent
        operator, the system will make a dummy entry for that operator in the
        system catalog.  This dummy entry will have valid data only
        for the operator name, left and right operand types, and result type,
        since that's all that <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> can deduce
        at this point.  The first operator's catalog entry will link to this
        dummy entry.  Later, when you define the second operator, the system
        updates the dummy entry with the additional information from the second
        definition.  If you try to use the dummy operator before it's been filled
        in, you'll just get an error message.

     at run time if no such operator family exists.  The system needs the
     operator family to find the data-type-specific hash function(s) for the

     hash functions before you can create the operator family.

     <CODE

     functions to ensure that the unused bits are always zero, which is the
     recommended strategy.)
     Another example is that on machines that meet the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>IEEE</ACRONYM
>
     floating-point standard, negative zero and positive zero are different
     values (different bit patterns) but they are defined to compare equal.
     If a float value might contain negative zero then extra steps are needed
     to ensure it generates the same hash value as positive zero.

     If this is not the case, planner errors might occur when the operator
     is used.  Also, it is a good idea (but not strictly required) for
     a hash operator family that supports multiple data types to provide
