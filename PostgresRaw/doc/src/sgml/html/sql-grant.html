>Description</H2
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GRANT</TT
> command has two basic variants: one
   that grants privileges on a database object (table, column, view, sequence,
   database, foreign-data wrapper, foreign server, function,
   procedural language, schema, or tablespace), and one that grants
   membership in a role.  These variants are similar in many ways, but
   they are different enough to be described separately.
  </P
><DIV
CLASS="REFSECT2"
><A
NAME="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION-OBJECTS"
></A
><H3
>GRANT on Database Objects</H3
><P
>   This variant of the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GRANT</TT
> command gives specific
   privileges on a database object to
   one or more roles.  These privileges are added
   to those already granted, if any.
  </P
><P
>   There is also an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same
   type within one or more schemas.  This functionality is currently supported
   only for tables, sequences, and functions (but note that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALL
   TABLES</TT
> is considered to include views).
  </P
><P
>   The key word <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
> indicates that the
   privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that might
   be created later.  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
> can be thought of as an
   implicitly defined group that always includes all roles.
   Any particular role will have the sum
   of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it
   is presently a member of, and privileges granted to
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
>.
  </P
><P
>   If <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH GRANT OPTION</TT
> is specified, the recipient
   of the privilege can in turn grant it to others.  Without a grant
   option, the recipient cannot do that.  Grant options cannot be granted
   to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
>.
  </P
><P
>   There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object
   (usually the user that created it),
   as the owner has all privileges by default.  (The owner could,
   however, choose to revoke some of his own privileges for safety.)
  </P
><P
>   The right to drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way, is
   not treated as a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the owner,
   and cannot be granted or revoked.  (However, a similar effect can be
   obtained by granting or revoking membership in the role that owns
   the object; see below.)  The owner implicitly has all grant
   options for the object, too.
  </P
><P
>   Depending on the type of object, the initial default privileges might
   include granting some privileges to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
>.
   The default is no public access for tables, columns, schemas, and
   tablespaces;
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CONNECT</TT
> privilege and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>TEMP</TT
> table creation privilege
   for databases;
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>EXECUTE</TT
> privilege for functions; and
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USAGE</TT
> privilege for languages.
   The object owner can of course revoke these privileges.  (For maximum
   security, issue the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REVOKE</TT
> in the same transaction that
   creates the object; then there is no window in which another user
   can use the object.)
   Also, these initial default privilege settings can be changed using the
   <A
HREF="sql-alterdefaultprivileges.html"
>ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</A
>
   command.

   </P
><P
>    If the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Access privileges"</SPAN

    it means the object has default privileges (that is, its privileges column
    is null).  Default privileges always include all privileges for the owner,
    and can include some privileges for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT

    object type, as explained above.  The first <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GRANT</TT
> or
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REVOKE</TT
> on an object
    will instantiate the default privileges (producing, for example,
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>{miriam=arwdDxt/miriam}</TT
>) and then modify them per the
    specified request.  Similarly, entries are shown in <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Column access
    privileges"</SPAN
> only for columns with nondefault privileges.
    (Note: for this purpose, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"default privileges"</SPAN
> always means the
    built-in default privileges for the object's type.  An object whose
    privileges have been affected by an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</TT
>
    command will always be shown with an explicit privilege entry that
    includes the effects of the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER</TT
>.)
   </P
><P
>    Notice that the owner's implicit grant options are not marked in the
    access privileges display.  A <TT

    grant options have been explicitly granted to someone.

    privileges.  This is not possible according to the SQL standard.  The
    reason is that <SPAN

    privileges as having been granted by the owner to himself; therefore he
    can revoke them too.  In the SQL standard, the owner's privileges are
