><P>
   Build a new index.  The index relation has been physically created,
   but is empty.  It must be filled in with whatever fixed data the
   access method requires, plus entries for all tuples already existing
   in the table.  Ordinarily the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ambuild</CODE
> function will call
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>IndexBuildHeapScan()</CODE
> to scan the table for existing tuples
   and compute the keys that need to be inserted into the index.
   The function must return a palloc'd struct containing statistics about
   the new index.

   Insert a new tuple into an existing index.  The <TT

>values</TT
> and
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>isnull</TT

   <TT

   If the access method supports unique indexes (its
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_am</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>amcanunique</TT
> flag is true) then
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>checkUnique</TT

   perform.  This varies depending on whether the unique constraint is
   deferrable; see <A
HREF="index-unique-checks.html"
>Section 51.5</A
> for details.
   Normally the access method only needs the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>heapRelation</TT
>
   parameter when performing uniqueness checking (since then it will have to
   look into the heap to verify tuple liveness).
  </P
><P
>   The function's Boolean result value is significant only when
   <TT

   In this case a TRUE result means the new entry is known unique, whereas
   FALSE means it might be non-unique (and a deferred uniqueness check must
   be scheduled).  For other cases a constant FALSE result is recommended.
  </P
><P

   Delete tuple(s) from the index.  This is a <SPAN

   that is intended to be implemented by scanning the whole index and checking
   each entry to see if it should be deleted.

   Clean up after a <TT

   <CODE

   The statistics it contains will be used to update <TT

   and will be reported by <TT

   It is OK to return NULL if the index was not changed at all during the

>bytea *
amoptions (ArrayType *reloptions,

   Parse and validate the reloptions array for an index.  This is called only
   when a non-null reloptions array exists for the index.
   <TT

   The function should construct a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bytea</TT
> value, which will be copied
   into the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>rd_options</TT
> field of the index's relcache entry.
   The data contents of the <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bytea</TT
> value are open for the access
   method to define; most of the standard access methods use struct
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>StdRdOptions</TT
>.
   When <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>validate</TT
> is true, the function should report a suitable
   error message if any of the options are unrecognized or have invalid
   values; when <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>validate</TT
> is false, invalid entries should be
   silently ignored.  (<TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>validate</TT
> is false when loading options
   already stored in <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_catalog</TT
>; an invalid entry could only
   be found if the access method has changed its rules for options, and in
   that case ignoring obsolete entries is appropriate.)
   It is OK to return NULL if default behavior is wanted.
  </P

>   The purpose of an index, of course, is to support scans for tuples matching

ambeginscan (Relation indexRelation,

   Begin a new scan.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>key</TT
> array (of length <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nkeys</TT
>)
   describes the scan key(s) for the index scan.  The result must be a

   <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

amgettuple (IndexScanDesc scan,
            ScanDirection direction);</PRE
><P>
   Fetch the next tuple in the given scan, moving in the given
   direction (forward or backward in the index).  Returns TRUE if a tuple was
   obtained, FALSE if no matching tuples remain.  In the TRUE case the tuple
   TID is stored into the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>scan</TT
> structure.  Note that
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"success"</SPAN
> means only that the index contains an entry that matches
   the scan keys, not that the tuple necessarily still exists in the heap or
   will pass the caller's snapshot test.  On success, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>amgettuple</CODE
>
   must also set <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>scan-&gt;xs_recheck</TT
> to TRUE or FALSE.
   FALSE means it is certain that the index entry matches the scan keys.
   TRUE means this is not certain, and the conditions represented by the
   scan keys must be rechecked against the heap tuple after fetching it.
   This provision supports <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"lossy"</SPAN
> index operators.
   Note that rechecking will extend only to the scan conditions; a partial
   index predicate (if any) is never rechecked by <CODE

amgetbitmap (IndexScanDesc scan,

   Fetch all tuples in the given scan and add them to the caller-supplied
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>TIDBitmap</TT
> (that is, OR the set of tuple IDs into whatever set is already
   in the bitmap).  The number of tuples fetched is returned (this might be
   just an approximate count, for instance some AMs do not detect duplicates).
   While inserting tuple IDs into the bitmap, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>amgetbitmap</CODE
> can
   indicate that rechecking of the scan conditions is required for specific
   tuple IDs.  This is analogous to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>xs_recheck</TT
> output parameter
   of <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>amgettuple</CODE
>.  Note: in the current implementation, support
   for this feature is conflated with support for lossy storage of the bitmap
   itself, and therefore callers recheck both the scan conditions and the
   partial index predicate (if any) for recheckable tuples.  That might not
   always be true, however.
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

   <CODE

   Restart the given scan, possibly with new scan keys (to continue using
   the old keys, NULL is passed for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>key</TT
>).  Note that it is not
   possible for the number of keys to be changed.  In practice the restart
   feature is used when a new outer tuple is selected by a nested-loop join
   and so a new key comparison value is needed, but the scan key structure
   remains the same.  This function is also called by
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>RelationGetIndexScan()</CODE

   of an index scan as well as rescanning.

   End a scan and release resources.  The <TT

   Restore the scan to the most recently marked position.

>   By convention, the <TT

   access method function should show the correct number of arguments,
   but declare them all as type <TT

> (since most of the arguments
   have types that are not known to SQL, and we don't want users calling
   the functions directly anyway).  The return type is declared as
   <TT

CLASS="TYPE"
