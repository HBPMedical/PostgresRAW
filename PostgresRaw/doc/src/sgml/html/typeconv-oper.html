defined in the standard catalog, and it takes an argument of type

So the parser does a type conversion on the operand and the query
is equivalent to:

>In this case there is no initial hint for which type to use, since no types
are specified in the query. So, the parser looks for all candidate operators
and finds that there are candidates accepting both string-category and
bit-string-category inputs.  Since string category is preferred when available,
that category is selected, and then the
preferred type for strings, <TT

type to resolve the unknown literals as.</P

>The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

entries for the prefix operator <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>@</TT
>, all of which implement
absolute-value operations for various numeric data types.  One of these
entries is for type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT
>, which is the preferred type in
the numeric category.  Therefore, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

will use that entry when faced with an <TT

>unknown</TT
> input:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>SELECT @ '-4.5' AS "abs";
 abs
-----
 4.5
(1 row)</PRE
><P>
Here the system has implicitly resolved the unknown-type literal as type
<TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT
> before applying the chosen operator.  We can verify that
<TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT
> and not some other type was used:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>SELECT @ '-4.5e500' AS "abs";

ERROR:  "-4.5e500" is out of range for type double precision</PRE
><P></P
><P
>On the other hand, the prefix operator <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>~</TT
> (bitwise negation)
is defined only for integer data types, not for <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT
>.  So, if we
try a similar case with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>~</TT
>, we get:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>SELECT ~ '20' AS "negation";

ERROR:  operator is not unique: ~ "unknown"
HINT:  Could not choose a best candidate operator. You might need to add
explicit type casts.</PRE
><P>
This happens because the system cannot decide which of the several
possible <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>~</TT
> operators should be preferred.  We can help
it out with an explicit cast:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>SELECT ~ CAST('20' AS int8) AS "negation";
