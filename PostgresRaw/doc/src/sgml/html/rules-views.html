>    Views in <SPAN

    using the rule system. In fact, there is essentially no difference
    between:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE VIEW myview AS SELECT * FROM mytab;</PRE
><P>
    
    compared against the two commands:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

CREATE RULE "_RETURN" AS ON SELECT TO myview DO INSTEAD

><P>
    
    because this is exactly what the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE VIEW</TT
>
    command does internally.  This has some side effects. One of them
    is that the information about a view in the
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> system catalogs is exactly
    the same as it is for a table. So for the parser, there is
    absolutely no difference between a table and a view. They are the
    same thing: relations.</P

></H2
><P
>    Rules <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON SELECT</TT

    if the command given is an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
>,
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
>. And they
    have different semantics from rules on the other command types in that they modify the
    query tree in place instead of creating a new one.  So
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> rules are described first.</P
><P
>    Currently, there can be only one action in an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON SELECT</TT
> rule, and it must
    be an unconditional <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> action that is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</TT
>. This restriction was
    required to make rules safe enough to open them for ordinary users, and
    it restricts <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON SELECT</TT
> rules to act like views.</P
><P
>    The examples for this chapter are two join views that do some
    calculations and some more views using them in turn.  One of the
    two first views is customized later by adding rules for
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>, and
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
> operations so that the final result will
    be a view that behaves like a real table with some magic
    functionality.  This is not such a simple example to start from and
    this makes things harder to get into. But it's better to have one
    example that covers all the points discussed step by step rather
    than having many different ones that might mix up in mind.</P
><P
>For the example, we need a little <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>min</TT

returns the lower of 2 integer values. We create that as:

>    This is the simplest <TT

    views, so we take this opportunity to explain the basics of view
    rules.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT * FROM shoelace</TT

    interpreted by the parser and produced the query tree:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

       shoelace.sl_unit, shoelace.sl_len_cm
  FROM shoelace shoelace;</PRE
><P>

    and this is given to the rule system. The rule system walks through the
    range table and checks if there are rules
    for any relation. When processing the range table entry for
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace</TT
> (the only one up to now) it finds the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_RETURN</TT
> rule with the query tree:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

       shoelace_data s, unit u
 WHERE s.sl_unit = u.un_name;</PRE
><P></P
><P
>    To expand the view, the rewriter simply creates a subquery range-table
    entry containing the rule's action query tree, and substitutes this
    range table entry for the original one that referenced the view.  The 
    resulting rewritten query tree is almost the same as if you had typed:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT shoelace.sl_name, shoelace.sl_avail,
       shoelace.sl_color, shoelace.sl_len,
       shoelace.sl_unit, shoelace.sl_len_cm
  FROM (SELECT s.sl_name,
               s.sl_avail,
               s.sl_color,
               s.sl_len,
               s.sl_unit,
               s.sl_len * u.un_fact AS sl_len_cm
          FROM shoelace_data s, unit u
         WHERE s.sl_unit = u.un_name) shoelace;</PRE
><P>

     There is one difference however: the subquery's range table has two
     extra entries <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace old</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace new</TT
>.  These entries don't
     participate directly in the query, since they aren't referenced by
     the subquery's join tree or target list.  The rewriter uses them
     to store the access privilege check information that was originally present
     in the range-table entry that referenced the view.  In this way, the
     executor will still check that the user has proper privileges to access
     the view, even though there's no direct use of the view in the rewritten
     query.</P
><P
>    That was the first rule applied.  The rule system will continue checking
    the remaining range-table entries in the top query (in this example there
    are no more), and it will recursively check the range-table entries in
    the added subquery to see if any of them reference views.  (But it
    won't expand <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>old</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>new</TT
> &mdash; otherwise we'd have infinite recursion!)
    In this example, there are no rewrite rules for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace_data</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unit</TT
>,
    so rewriting is complete and the above is the final result given to
    the planner.</P
><P
>    Now we want to write a query that finds out for which shoes currently in the store
    we have the matching shoelaces (color and length) and where the
    total number of exactly matching pairs is greater or equal to two.

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

    and thus the executor run over the join will produce exactly the
    same result set as a:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT t1.a, t2.b FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.a;</PRE
><P>
    
    will do. But there is a little problem in
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>: The executor does not care what the
    results from the join it is doing are meant for. It just produces
    a result set of rows. The difference that one is a
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> command and the other is an
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> is handled in the caller of the
    executor. The caller still knows (looking at the query tree) that
    this is an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>, and it knows that this
    result should go into table <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t1</TT
>. But which of the rows that are
    there has to be replaced by the new row?</P
><P
>    To resolve this problem, another entry is added to the target list
    in <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> (and also in
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
>) statements: the current tuple ID
    (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CTID</ACRONYM
>).
    This is a system column containing the
    file block number and position in the block for the row. Knowing
    the table, the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CTID</ACRONYM
> can be used to retrieve the
    original row of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t1</TT
> to be updated.  After adding the
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CTID</ACRONYM
> to the target list, the query actually looks like:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT t1.a, t2.b, t1.ctid FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.a;</PRE
><P>
    
    Now another detail of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> enters
    the stage. Old table rows aren't overwritten, and this
    is why <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ROLLBACK</TT
> is fast. In an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>,
    the new result row is inserted into the table (after stripping the
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CTID</ACRONYM
>) and in the row header of the old row, which the
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CTID</ACRONYM
> pointed to, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cmax</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>xmax</TT
> entries are set to the current command counter
    and current transaction ID. Thus the old row is hidden, and after
    the transaction commits the vacuum cleaner can really remove it.</P

    the same way to any command. There is no difference.</P

>    The above demonstrates how the rule system incorporates view
    definitions into the original query tree. In the second example, a
    simple <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> from one view created a final
    query tree that is a join of 4 tables (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unit</TT
> was used twice with
    different names).</P
><P
>    The benefit of implementing views with the rule system is,
    that the planner has all
    the information about which tables have to be scanned plus the
    relationships between these tables plus the restrictive
    qualifications from the views plus the qualifications from
    the original query
    in one single query tree. And this is still the situation
    when the original query is already a join over views.
    The planner has to decide which is
    the best path to execute the query, and the more information
    the planner has, the better this decision can be. And
    the rule system as implemented in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
    ensures, that this is all information available about the query
    up to that point.</P
