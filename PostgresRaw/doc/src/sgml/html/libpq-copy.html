></H1
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> command in
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> has options to read from or write
   to the network connection used by <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libpq</SPAN
>.
   The functions described in this section allow applications to take
   advantage of this capability by supplying or consuming copied data.
  </P
><P
>   The overall process is that the application first issues the SQL
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> command via <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQexec</CODE
> or one
   of the equivalent functions.  The response to this (if there is no
   error in the command) will be a <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>PGresult</TT
> object bearing
   a status code of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_COPY_OUT</TT
> or
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_COPY_IN</TT
> (depending on the specified copy
   direction).  The application should then use the functions of this
   section to receive or transmit data rows.  When the data transfer is
   complete, another <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>PGresult</TT
> object is returned to indicate
   success or failure of the transfer.  Its status will be
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_COMMAND_OK</TT
> for success or
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_FATAL_ERROR</TT
> if some problem was encountered.
   At this point further SQL commands can be issued via
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQexec</CODE
>.  (It is not possible to execute other SQL
   commands using the same connection while the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
>
   operation is in progress.)
  </P
><P
>   If a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> command is issued via
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQexec</CODE
> in a string that could contain additional
   commands, the application must continue fetching results via
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE

CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
>
   sequence.  Only when <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE
> returns
   <TT
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>NULL</TT

CLASS="SYNOPSIS"

><P>
       This function waits until the  server  has  finished  the copying.
       It should either be issued when the  last  string  has  been sent
       to  the  server using <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQputline</CODE
> or when the
       last string has been  received  from  the  server using
       <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PGgetline</CODE
>.  It must be issued or the server
       will get <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"out of sync"</SPAN
> with  the client.   Upon return
       from this function, the server is ready to receive the next SQL
       command.  The return value is 0  on  successful  completion,
       nonzero otherwise.  (Use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQerrorMessage</CODE
> to
       retrieve details if the return value is nonzero.)
      </P
><P
>       When using <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE
>, the application should
       respond to a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_COPY_OUT</TT
> result by executing
       <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetline</CODE
> repeatedly, followed by
       <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQendcopy</CODE
> after the terminator line is seen.
       It should then return to the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE
> loop
       until <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE
> returns a null pointer.
       Similarly a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PGRES_COPY_IN</TT
> result is processed
       by a series of <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQputline</CODE
> calls followed by
       <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQendcopy</CODE
>, then return to the
       <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQgetResult</CODE
> loop.  This arrangement will
       ensure that a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> command embedded in a series
       of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> commands will be executed correctly.
      </P
><P
>       Older applications are likely to submit a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
>
       via <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQexec</CODE
> and assume that the transaction
       is done after <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>PQendcopy</CODE
>.  This will work
       correctly only if the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> is the only
       <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> command in the command string.
