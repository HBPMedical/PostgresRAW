        of increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL.
        (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient
        to do this during the first change of each page after a checkpoint.

        increase the checkpoint interval parameters.)

        traffic (or has slack periods where it does so), there could be a
        long delay between the completion of a transaction and its safe
        recording in archive storage.  To limit how old unarchived

        segment file whenever this many seconds have elapsed since the last

        including a single checkpoint.  (Increasing

        Note that archived files that are closed early
