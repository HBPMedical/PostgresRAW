></H1
><P
>   Reliability is an important property of any serious database
   system, and <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> does everything possible to
   guarantee reliable operation. One aspect of reliable operation is
   that all data recorded by a committed transaction should be stored
   in a nonvolatile area that is safe from power loss, operating
   system failure, and hardware failure (except failure of the
   nonvolatile area itself, of course).  Successfully writing the data
   to the computer's permanent storage (disk drive or equivalent)
   ordinarily meets this requirement.  In fact, even if a computer is
   fatally damaged, if the disk drives survive they can be moved to
   another computer with similar hardware and all committed
   transactions will remain intact.
  </P
><P
>   While forcing data periodically to the disk platters might seem like
   a simple operation, it is not. Because disk drives are dramatically
   slower than main memory and CPUs, several layers of caching exist
   between the computer's main memory and the disk platters.
   First, there is the operating system's buffer cache, which caches
   frequently requested disk blocks and combines disk writes. Fortunately,
   all operating systems give applications a way to force writes from
   the buffer cache to disk, and <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> uses those
   features.  (See the <A
HREF="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-SYNC-METHOD"
>wal_sync_method</A
> parameter
   to adjust how this is done.)
  </P
><P
>   Next, there might be a cache in the disk drive controller; this is
   particularly common on <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RAID</ACRONYM
> controller cards. Some of
   these caches are <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>write-through</I
>, meaning writes are sent
   to the drive as soon as they arrive. Others are
   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>write-back</I
>, meaning data is sent to the drive at
   some later time. Such caches can be a reliability hazard because the
   memory in the disk controller cache is volatile, and will lose its
   contents in a power failure.  Better controller cards have
   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>battery-backed unit</I
> (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BBU</ACRONYM
>) caches, meaning
   the card has a battery that
   maintains power to the cache in case of system power loss.  After power
   is restored the data will be written to the disk drives.
  </P
><P
>   And finally, most disk drives have caches. Some are write-through
   while some are write-back, and the same concerns about data loss
   exist for write-back drive caches as exist for disk controller
   caches.  Consumer-grade IDE and SATA drives are particularly likely
   to have write-back caches that will not survive a power failure,
   though <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ATAPI-6</ACRONYM
> introduced a drive cache flush command
   (<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>FLUSH CACHE EXT</TT
>) that some file systems use, e.g.
   <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ZFS</ACRONYM
>, <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ext4</ACRONYM
>.  (The SCSI command
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SYNCHRONIZE CACHE</TT
> has long been available.) Many
   solid-state drives (SSD) also have volatile write-back caches, and
   many do not honor cache flush commands by default.
  </P
><P
>   To check write caching on <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Linux</SPAN
> use
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hdparm -I</TT
>;  it is enabled if there is a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*</TT

   to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Write cache</TT
>; <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hdparm -W</TT
> to turn off
   write caching.  On <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeBSD</SPAN
> use
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>atacontrol</SPAN
>.  (For SCSI disks use <A
HREF="http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sdparm.html"
TARGET="_top"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>sdparm</SPAN
></A
>
   to turn off <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WCE</TT
>.)  On <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Solaris</SPAN
> the disk
   write cache is controlled by <A
HREF="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/submitted/format_utility.jsp"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>format
   -e</TT
></A
>. (The Solaris <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ZFS</ACRONYM
> file system is safe with
   disk write-cache enabled because it issues its own disk cache flush
   commands.)  On <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows</SPAN
> if <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>wal_sync_method</TT
>
   is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>open_datasync</TT
> (the default), write caching is disabled
   by unchecking <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>My Computer\Open\{select disk
   drive}\Properties\Hardware\Properties\Policies\Enable write caching on
   the disk</TT
>.  Also on Windows, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fsync</TT
> and
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fsync_writethrough</TT
> never do write caching.
  </P
><P
>   Many file systems that use write barriers (e.g.  <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ZFS</ACRONYM
>,
   <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ext4</ACRONYM
>) internally use <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>FLUSH CACHE EXT</TT
> or
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SYNCHRONIZE CACHE</TT
> commands to flush data to the platters on
   write-back-enabled drives.  Unfortunately, such write barrier file
   systems behave suboptimally when combined with battery-backed unit
   (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BBU</ACRONYM
>) disk controllers.  In such setups, the synchronize
   command forces all data from the BBU to the disks, eliminating much
   of the benefit of the BBU.  You can run the utility
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/tools/fsync</TT
> in the PostgreSQL source tree to see
   if you are affected.  If you are affected, the performance benefits
   of the BBU cache can be regained by turning off write barriers in
   the file system or reconfiguring the disk controller, if that is
   an option.  If write barriers are turned off, make sure the battery
   remains active; a faulty battery can potentially lead to data loss.
   Hopefully file system and disk controller designers will eventually
   address this suboptimal behavior.
  </P
><P
>   When the operating system sends a write request to the storage hardware,
   there is little it can do to make sure the data has arrived at a truly
   non-volatile storage area. Rather, it is the
   administrator's responsibility to make certain that all storage components
   ensure data integrity.  Avoid disk controllers that have non-battery-backed
   write caches.  At the drive level, disable write-back caching if the
   drive cannot guarantee the data will be written before shutdown.
   You can test for reliable I/O subsystem behavior using <A

>   Another risk of data loss is posed by the disk platter write
   operations themselves. Disk platters are divided into sectors,
   commonly 512 bytes each.  Every physical read or write operation
   processes a whole sector.
   When a write request arrives at the drive, it might be for 512 bytes,
   1024 bytes, or 8192 bytes, and the process of writing could fail due
   to power loss at any time, meaning some of the 512-byte sectors were
   written, and others were not.  To guard against such failures,
   <SPAN

   restore partially-written pages.  If you have a battery-backed disk
   controller or file-system software that prevents partial page writes
   (e.g., ZFS),  you can turn off this page imaging by turning off the
   <A
