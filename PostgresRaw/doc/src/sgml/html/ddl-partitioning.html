><P
>    Partitioning refers to splitting what is logically one large table
    into smaller physical pieces.
    Partitioning can provide several benefits:
   <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>      Query performance can be improved dramatically in certain situations,
      particularly when most of the heavily accessed rows of the table are in a
      single partition or a small number of partitions.  The partitioning
      substitutes for leading columns of indexes, reducing index size and
      making it more likely that the heavily-used parts of the indexes
      fit in memory.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      When queries or updates access a large percentage of a single
      partition, performance can be improved by taking advantage
      of sequential scan of that partition instead of using an
      index and random access reads scattered across the whole table.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Bulk loads and deletes can be accomplished by adding or removing
      partitions, if that requirement is planned into the partitioning design.
      <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ALTER TABLE</TT
> is far faster than a bulk operation.
      It also entirely avoids the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>
      overhead caused by a bulk <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
>.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Seldom-used data can be migrated to cheaper and slower storage media.
     </P
></LI
></UL
><P>

    The benefits will normally be worthwhile only when a table would
    otherwise be very large. The exact point at which a table will
    benefit from partitioning depends on the application, although a
    rule of thumb is that the size of the table should exceed the physical
    memory of the database server.
   </P
><P
>    Currently, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> supports partitioning
    via table inheritance.  Each partition must be created as a child
    table of a single parent table.  The parent table itself is normally
    empty; it exists just to represent the entire data set.  You should be
    familiar with inheritance (see <A
HREF="ddl-inherit.html"
>Section 5.8</A
>) before
    attempting to set up partitioning.

     ice cream company. The company measures peak temperatures every
     day as well as ice cream sales in each region. Conceptually,
     we want a table like:

</P><PRE

     We know that most queries will access just the last week's, month's or
     quarter's data, since the main use of this table will be to prepare
     online reports for management.
     To reduce the amount of old data that needs to be stored, we
     decide to only keep the most recent 3 years worth of data. At the
     beginning of each month we will remove the oldest month's data.
    </P
><P
>     In this situation we can use partitioning to help us meet all of our
     different requirements for the measurements table. Following the
     steps outlined above, partitioning can be set up as follows:

        a suitable trigger function to the master table.
        If data will be added only to the latest partition, we can

        calls the trigger function:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TRIGGER insert_measurement_trigger
    BEFORE INSERT ON measurement
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE measurement_insert_trigger();</PRE
><P>

        We must redefine the trigger function each month so that it always
        points to the current partition.  The trigger definition does
        not need to be updated, however.
       </P
><P
>        We might want to insert data and have the server automatically
        locate the partition into which the row should be added. We
        could do this with a more complex trigger function, for example:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION measurement_insert_trigger()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF ( NEW.logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-02-01' AND
         NEW.logdate &lt; DATE '2006-03-01' ) THEN
        INSERT INTO measurement_y2006m02 VALUES (NEW.*);
    ELSIF ( NEW.logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-03-01' AND
            NEW.logdate &lt; DATE '2006-04-01' ) THEN
        INSERT INTO measurement_y2006m03 VALUES (NEW.*);
    ...
    ELSIF ( NEW.logdate &gt;= DATE '2008-01-01' AND
            NEW.logdate &lt; DATE '2008-02-01' ) THEN
        INSERT INTO measurement_y2008m01 VALUES (NEW.*);
    ELSE
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Date out of range.  Fix the measurement_insert_trigger() function!';
    END IF;
    RETURN NULL;

$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;</PRE

>     Normally the set of partitions established when initially
     defining the table are not intended to remain static. It is
     common to want to remove old partitions of data and periodically
     add new partitions for new data. One of the most important
     advantages of partitioning is precisely that it allows this
     otherwise painful task to be executed nearly instantaneously by
     manipulating the partition structure, rather than physically moving large
     amounts of data around.
   </P
><P
>     The simplest option for removing old data is simply to drop the partition
     that is no longer necessary:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>DROP TABLE measurement_y2006m02;</PRE
><P>
     This can very quickly delete millions of records because it doesn't have
     to individually delete every record.
   </P
><P
>     Another option that is often preferable is to remove the partition from
     the partitioned table but retain access to it as a table in its own
     right:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>ALTER TABLE measurement_y2006m02 NO INHERIT measurement;</PRE
><P>
     This allows further operations to be performed on the data before
     it is dropped. For example, this is often a useful time to back up
     the data using <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
>, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
>, or
     similar tools. It might also be a useful time to aggregate data
     into smaller formats, perform other data manipulations, or run
     reports.
   </P
><P
>     Similarly we can add a new partition to handle new data. We can create an
     empty partition in the partitioned table just as the original partitions
     were created above:

</P><PRE

) INHERITS (measurement);</PRE
><P>

     As an alternative, it is sometimes more convenient to create the
     new table outside the partition structure, and make it a proper
     partition later. This allows the data to be loaded, checked, and
     transformed prior to it appearing in the partitioned table:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLE measurement_y2008m02

ALTER TABLE measurement_y2008m02 ADD CONSTRAINT y2008m02
   CHECK ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2008-02-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2008-03-01' );
\copy measurement_y2008m02 from 'measurement_y2008m02'

    constraints, not by the presence of indexes.  Therefore it isn't
    necessary to define indexes on the key columns.  Whether an index
    needs to be created for a given partition depends on whether you
    expect that queries that scan the partition will generally scan
    a large part of the partition or just a small part.  An index will
    be helpful in the latter case but not the former.

NAME="DDL-PARTITIONING-ALTERNATIVES"
>5.9.5. Alternative Partitioning Methods</A
></H2
><P
>     A different approach to redirecting inserts into the appropriate
     partition table is to set up rules, instead of a trigger, on the
     master table.  For example:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE RULE measurement_insert_y2006m02 AS
ON INSERT TO measurement WHERE
    ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2006-02-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2006-03-01' )
DO INSTEAD
    INSERT INTO measurement_y2006m02 VALUES (NEW.*);
...
CREATE RULE measurement_insert_y2008m01 AS
ON INSERT TO measurement WHERE
    ( logdate &gt;= DATE '2008-01-01' AND logdate &lt; DATE '2008-02-01' )
DO INSTEAD
    INSERT INTO measurement_y2008m01 VALUES (NEW.*);</PRE
><P>

     A rule has significantly more overhead than a trigger, but the overhead
     is paid once per query rather than once per row, so this method might be
     advantageous for bulk-insert situations.  In most cases, however, the
     trigger method will offer better performance.
    </P
><P
>     Be aware that <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> ignores rules.  If you want to
     use <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> to insert data, you'll need to copy into the correct
     partition table rather than into the master.  <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COPY</TT
> does fire
     triggers, so you can use it normally if you use the trigger approach.
    </P
><P
>     Another disadvantage of the rule approach is that there is no simple
     way to force an error if the set of rules doesn't cover the insertion
     date; the data will silently go into the master table instead.
    </P
><P
>     Partitioning can also be arranged using a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION ALL</TT
>
     view, instead of table inheritance.  For example,

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE VIEW measurement AS
          SELECT * FROM measurement_y2006m02
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM measurement_y2006m03
...
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM measurement_y2007m11
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM measurement_y2007m12
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM measurement_y2008m01;</PRE
><P>

     However, the need to recreate the view adds an extra step to adding and
     dropping individual partitions of the data set.  In practice this
     method has little to recommend it compared to using inheritance.

      If you need to handle such cases, you can put suitable update triggers

><P
>      Keep the partitioning constraints simple, else the planner may not be
      able to prove that partitions don't need to be visited.  Use simple
      equality conditions for list partitioning, or simple
      range tests for range partitioning, as illustrated in the preceding
      examples.  A good rule of thumb is that partitioning constraints should
      contain only comparisons of the partitioning column(s) to constants
      using B-tree-indexable operators.

>      All constraints on all partitions of the master table are examined
      during constraint exclusion, so large numbers of partitions are likely
      to increase query planning time considerably.  Partitioning using
      these techniques will work well with up to perhaps a hundred partitions;
      don't try to use many thousands of partitions.
