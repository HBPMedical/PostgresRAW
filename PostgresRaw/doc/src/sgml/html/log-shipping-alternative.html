>    An alternative to the built-in standby mode described in the previous
    sections is to use a <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> that polls the archive location.
    This was the only option available in versions 8.4 and below. In this
    setup, set <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>standby_mode</TT
> off, because you are implementing
    the polling required for standby operation yourself. See
    contrib/pg_standby (<A
HREF="pgstandby.html"
>Section F.28</A
>) for a reference
    implementation of this.
   </P
><P
>    Note that in this mode, the server will apply WAL one file at a
    time, so if you use the standby server for queries (see Hot Standby),
    there is a delay between an action in the master and when the
    action becomes visible in the standby, corresponding the time it takes
    to fill up the WAL file. <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>archive_timeout</TT
> can be used to make that delay
    shorter. Also note that you can't combine streaming replication with
    this method.
   </P
><P
>    The operations that occur on both primary and standby servers are
    normal continuous archiving and recovery tasks. The only point of
    contact between the two database servers is the archive of WAL files
    that both share: primary writing to the archive, standby reading from
    the archive. Care must be taken to ensure that WAL archives from separate
    primary servers do not become mixed together or confused. The archive
    need not be large if it is only required for standby operation.
   </P
><P
>    The magic that makes the two loosely coupled servers work together is
    simply a <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> used on the standby that,
    when asked for the next WAL file, waits for it to become available from
    the primary. The <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> is specified in the
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>recovery.conf</TT
> file on the standby server. Normal recovery
    processing would request a file from the WAL archive, reporting failure
    if the file was unavailable.  For standby processing it is normal for
    the next WAL file to be unavailable, so the standby must wait for
    it to appear. For files ending in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.backup</TT
> or
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.history</TT
> there is no need to wait, and a non-zero return
    code must be returned. A waiting <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> can be
    written as a custom script that loops after polling for the existence of
    the next WAL file. There must also be some way to trigger failover, which
    should interrupt the <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
>, break the loop and
    return a file-not-found error to the standby server. This ends recovery
    and the standby will then come up as a normal server.
   </P
><P
>    Pseudocode for a suitable <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> is:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>triggered = false;
while (!NextWALFileReady() &amp;&amp; !triggered)
{
    sleep(100000L);         /* wait for ~0.1 sec */
    if (CheckForExternalTrigger())
        triggered = true;
}
if (!triggered)
        CopyWALFileForRecovery();</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    A working example of a waiting <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> is provided
    as a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> module named <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_standby</SPAN
>. It
    should be used as a reference on how to correctly implement the logic
    described above. It can also be extended as needed to support specific
    configurations and environments.
   </P
><P
>    The method for triggering failover is an important part of planning
    and design. One potential option is the <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
>
    command.  It is executed once for each WAL file, but the process
    running the <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> is created and dies for
    each file, so there is no daemon or server process, and
    signals or a signal handler cannot be used. Therefore, the
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> is not suitable to trigger failover.
    It is possible to use a simple timeout facility, especially if
    used in conjunction with a known <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>archive_timeout</TT
>
    setting on the primary. However, this is somewhat error prone
    since a network problem or busy primary server might be sufficient
    to initiate failover. A notification mechanism such as the explicit
    creation of a trigger file is ideal, if this can be arranged.

>    An external program can call the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_xlogfile_name_offset()</CODE

    function (see <A
HREF="functions-admin.html"
>Section 9.24</A
>)
    to find out the file name and the exact byte offset within it of
    the current end of WAL.  It can then access the WAL file directly
    and copy the data from the last known end of WAL through the current end
    over to the standby servers.  With this approach, the window for data
    loss is the polling cycle time of the copying program, which can be very
    small, and there is no wasted bandwidth from forcing partially-used
    segment files to be archived.  Note that the standby servers'
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> scripts can only deal with whole WAL files,
    so the incrementally copied data is not ordinarily made available to
    the standby servers.  It is of use only when the primary dies &mdash;
    then the last partial WAL file is fed to the standby before allowing
    it to come up.  The correct implementation of this process requires
    cooperation of the <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>restore_command</TT
> script with the data
    copying program.
