>), and Version 2 was released in June 1990 with
   the new rule system.  Version 3 appeared in 1991 and added support
   for multiple storage managers, an improved query executor, and a
   rewritten rule system.  For the most part, subsequent releases
   until <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres95</SPAN
> (see below) focused on
   portability and reliability.
  </P

>   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

   different research and production applications.  These include: a
   financial data analysis system, a jet engine performance monitoring
   package, an asteroid tracking database, a medical information
   database, and several geographic information systems.
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>POSTGRES</SPAN
> has also been used as an
   educational tool at several universities.  Finally, Illustra
   Information Technologies (later merged into 
   <A

CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Informix</SPAN
></A

   which is now owned by <A

   commercialized it.  In late 1992,
   <SPAN

   for the 
   <A

  </P

>   The size of the external user community nearly doubled during 1993.
   It became increasingly obvious that maintenance of the prototype
   code and support was taking up large amounts of time that should
   have been devoted to database research.  In an effort to reduce
   this support burden, the Berkeley
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>POSTGRES</SPAN
> project officially ended with
   Version 4.2.

   bug fixes, the following were the major enhancements:
