>    The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the
    source tree for your system and choose the options you would like.
    This is done by running the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> script. For a
    default installation simply enter:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>./configure</KBD
></PRE
><P>
    This script will run a number of tests to determine values for various
    system dependent variables and detect any quirks of your
    operating system, and finally will create several files in the
    build tree to record what it found.  You can also run
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> in a directory outside the source
    tree, if you want to keep the build directory separate.  This
    procedure is also called a
    <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>VPATH</I
>
    build.  Here's how:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>mkdir build_dir</KBD
>
<KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>cd build_dir</KBD
>
<KBD

>
<KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>gmake</KBD
></PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    The default configuration will build the server and utilities, as
    well as all client applications and interfaces that require only a
    C compiler. All files will be installed under
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/pgsql</TT
> by default.
   </P
><P
>    You can customize the build and installation process by supplying one
    or more of the following command line options to
    <TT

        </P
><P
>         If you have special needs, you can also customize the
         individual subdirectories with the following options. However,
         if you leave these with their defaults, the installation will be
         relocatable, meaning you can move the directory after
         installation. (The <TT

         locations are not affected by this.)

         This means that you can run the programs in a debugger
         to analyze problems. This enlarges the size of the installed
         executables considerably, and on non-GCC compilers it usually
         also disables compiler optimization, causing slowdowns. However,
         having the symbols available is extremely helpful for dealing
         with any problems that might arise.  Currently, this option is
         recommended for production installations only if you use GCC.

    remove the debugging support, so it should only be done if
    debugging is no longer needed.  <TT

    tries to do a reasonable job saving space, but it does not have
    perfect knowledge of how to strip every unneeded byte from an
    executable file, so if you want to save all the disk space you
    possibly can, you will have to do manual work.

>configure</TT

    program, so that you can rebuild everything with <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gmake</TT
>
    later on. To reset the source tree to the state in which it was
    distributed, use <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gmake distclean</TT
>. If you are going to
    build for several platforms within the same source tree you must do
    this and re-configure for each platform.  (Alternatively, use
    a separate build tree for each platform, so that the source tree
    remains unmodified.)

   options were wrong, or if you change anything that <TT

   investigates (for example, software upgrades), then it's a good
   idea to do <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gmake distclean</TT
> before reconfiguring and
   rebuilding.  Without this, your changes in configuration choices
   might not propagate everywhere they need to.
