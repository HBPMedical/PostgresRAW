     the administrator cannot determine the actual password assigned
     to the user. If MD5 encryption is used for client authentication,
     the unencrypted password is never even temporarily present on the
     server because the client MD5-encrypts it before being sent
     across the network.

     complete access to the database server, such as the system
     administrator.

>Data Partition Encryption</DT
><DD
><P
>     On Linux, encryption can be layered on top of a file system
     using a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loopback device"</SPAN
>. This allows an entire
     file system partition to be encrypted on disk, and decrypted by the
     operating system. On FreeBSD, the equivalent facility is called
     GEOM Based Disk Encryption (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>gbde</ACRONYM
>), and many
     other operating systems support this functionality, including Windows.
    </P
><P
>     This mechanism prevents unencrypted data from being read from the
     drives if the drives or the entire computer is stolen. This does
     not protect against attacks while the file system is mounted,
     because when mounted, the operating system provides an unencrypted
     view of the data. However, to mount the file system, you need some
     way for the encryption key to be passed to the operating system,
     and sometimes the key is stored somewhere on the host that mounts
     the disk.

>Encrypting Passwords Across A Network</DT

><P
>      The <TT

> authentication method double-encrypts the
      password on the client before sending it to the server. It first
      MD5-encrypts it based on the user name, and then encrypts it
      based on a random salt sent by the server when the database
      connection was made. It is this double-encrypted value that is
      sent over the network to the server. Double-encryption not only
      prevents the password from being discovered, it also prevents
      another connection from using the same encrypted password to
      connect to the database server at a later time.

     certificates to each other. It takes some extra configuration
     on each side, but this provides stronger verification of identity
     than the mere use of passwords. It prevents a computer from
     pretending to be the server just long enough to read the password
     sent by the client. It also helps prevent <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"man in the middle"</SPAN

     attacks where a computer between the client and server pretends to
     be the server and reads and passes all data between the client and
     server.

     it is necessary
     for the client to encrypt the data; this way, unencrypted data
     never appears on the database server. Data is encrypted on the
     client before being sent to the server, and database results have
     to be decrypted on the client before being used.
