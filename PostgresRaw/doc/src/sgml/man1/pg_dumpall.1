.SH "NAME"
pg_dumpall \- extract a PostgreSQL database cluster into a script file
.\" pg_dumpall
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'pg_dumpall\ 'u
pg_dumpall [\fIconnection\-option\fR...] [\fIoption\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
pg_dumpall
is a utility for writing out (\(lqdumping\(rq) all
PostgreSQL
databases of a cluster into one script file\&. The script file contains
SQL
commands that can be used as input to
\fBpsql\fR(1)
to restore the databases\&. It does this by calling
\fBpg_dump\fR(1)
for each database in a cluster\&.
pg_dumpall
also dumps global objects that are common to all databases\&. (pg_dump
does not save these objects\&.) This currently includes information about database users and groups, tablespaces, and properties such as access permissions that apply to databases as a whole\&.
.PP
Since
pg_dumpall
reads tables from all databases you will most likely have to connect as a database superuser in order to produce a complete dump\&. Also you will need superuser privileges to execute the saved script in order to be allowed to add users and groups, and to create databases\&.
.PP
The SQL script will be written to the standard output\&. Use the [\-f|file] option or shell operators to redirect it into a file\&.
.PP
pg_dumpall
needs to connect several times to the
PostgreSQL
server (once per database)\&. If you use password authentication it will ask for a password each time\&. It is convenient to have a
~/\&.pgpass
file in such cases\&. See
Section 31.14, \(lqThe Password File\(rq, in the documentation
for more information\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following command\-line options control the content and format of the output\&.
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-data\-only\fR
.RS 4
Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR
.RS 4
Include SQL commands to clean (drop) databases before recreating them\&.
DROP
commands for roles and tablespaces are added as well\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f \fR\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR, \fB\-\-file=\fR\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR
.RS 4
Send output to the specified file\&. If this is omitted, the standard output is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-globals\-only\fR
.RS 4
Dump only global objects (roles and tablespaces), no databases\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-version\fR
.RS 4
A deprecated option that is now ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-oids\fR
.RS 4
Dump object identifiers (OIDs) as part of the data for every table\&. Use this option if your application references the
OID
columns in some way (e\&.g\&., in a foreign key constraint)\&. Otherwise, this option should not be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-no\-owner\fR
.RS 4
Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match the original database\&. By default,
pg_dumpall
issues
ALTER OWNER
or
SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
statements to set ownership of created schema elements\&. These statements will fail when the script is run unless it is started by a superuser (or the same user that owns all of the objects in the script)\&. To make a script that can be restored by any user, but will give that user ownership of all the objects, specify
\fB\-O\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-lock\-wait\-timeout=\fR\fB\fItimeout\fR\fR
.RS 4
Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the beginning of the dump\&. Instead, fail if unable to lock a table within the specified
\fItimeout\fR\&. The timeout may be specified in any of the formats accepted by
SET statement_timeout\&. Allowed values vary depending on the server version you are dumping from, but an integer number of milliseconds is accepted by all versions since 7\&.3\&. This option is ignored when dumping from a pre\-7\&.3 server\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-tablespaces\fR
.RS 4
Do not output commands to create tablespaces nor select tablespaces for objects\&. With this option, all objects will be created in whichever tablespace is the default during restore\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-roles\-only\fR
.RS 4
Dump only roles, no databases or tablespaces\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-schema\-only\fR
.RS 4
Dump only the object definitions (schema), not data\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S \fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR, \fB\-\-superuser=\fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling triggers\&. This is only relevant if
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
is used\&. (Usually, it\(aqs better to leave this out, and instead start the resulting script as superuser\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tablespaces\-only\fR
.RS 4
Dump only tablespaces, no databases or roles\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Specifies verbose mode\&. This will cause
pg_dumpall
to output start/stop times to the dump file, and progress messages to standard error\&. It will also enable verbose output in
pg_dump\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print the
pg_dumpall
version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-no\-privileges\fR, \fB\-\-no\-acl\fR
.RS 4
Prevent dumping of access privileges (grant/revoke commands)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-binary\-upgrade\fR
.RS 4
This option is for use by in\-place upgrade utilities\&. Its use for other purposes is not recommended or supported\&. The behavior of the option may change in future releases without notice\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-inserts\fR
.RS 4
Dump data as
INSERT
commands (rather than
COPY)\&. This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into non\-PostgreSQL
databases\&. Note that the restore might fail altogether if you have rearranged column order\&. The
\fB\-\-column\-inserts\fR
option is safer, though even slower\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-column\-inserts\fR, \fB\-\-attribute\-inserts\fR
.RS 4
Dump data as
INSERT
commands with explicit column names (INSERT INTO \fItable\fR (\fIcolumn\fR, \&.\&.\&.) VALUES \&.\&.\&.)\&. This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into non\-PostgreSQL
databases\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disable\-dollar\-quoting\fR
.RS 4
This option disables the use of dollar quoting for function bodies, and forces them to be quoted using SQL standard string syntax\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
.RS 4
This option is only relevant when creating a data\-only dump\&. It instructs
pg_dumpall
to include commands to temporarily disable triggers on the target tables while the data is reloaded\&. Use this if you have referential integrity checks or other triggers on the tables that you do not want to invoke during data reload\&.
.sp
Presently, the commands emitted for
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
must be done as superuser\&. So, you should also specify a superuser name with
\fB\-S\fR, or preferably be careful to start the resulting script as a superuser\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-use\-set\-session\-authorization\fR
.RS 4
Output SQL\-standard
SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
commands instead of
ALTER OWNER
commands to determine object ownership\&. This makes the dump more standards compatible, but depending on the history of the objects in the dump, might not restore properly\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show help about
pg_dumpall
command line arguments, and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
The following command\-line options control the database connection parameters\&.
.PP
\fB\-h \fR\fB\fIhost\fR\fR, \fB\-\-host=\fR\fB\fIhost\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the database server is running\&. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain socket\&. The default is taken from the
\fBPGHOST\fR
environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l \fR\fB\fIdbname\fR\fR, \fB\-\-database=\fR\fB\fIdbname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the name of the database to connect to to dump global objects and discover what other databases should be dumped\&. If not specified, the
postgres
database will be used, and if that does not exist,
template1
will be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR, \fB\-\-port=\fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is listening for connections\&. Defaults to the
\fBPGPORT\fR
environment variable, if set, or a compiled\-in default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-U \fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR, \fB\-\-username=\fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.RS 4
User name to connect as\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-no\-password\fR
.RS 4
Never issue a password prompt\&. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a
\&.pgpass
file, the connection attempt will fail\&. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR
.RS 4
Force
pg_dumpall
to prompt for a password before connecting to a database\&.
.sp
This option is never essential, since
pg_dumpall
will automatically prompt for a password if the server demands password authentication\&. However,
pg_dumpall
will waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password\&. In some cases it is worth typing
\fB\-W\fR
to avoid the extra connection attempt\&.
.sp
Note that the password prompt will occur again for each database to be dumped\&. Usually, it\(aqs better to set up a
~/\&.pgpass
file than to rely on manual password entry\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-role=\fR\fB\fIrolename\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a role name to be used to create the dump\&. This option causes
pg_dumpall
to issue a
SET ROLE\fIrolename\fR
command after connecting to the database\&. It is useful when the authenticated user (specified by
\fB\-U\fR) lacks privileges needed by
pg_dumpall, but can switch to a role with the required rights\&. Some installations have a policy against logging in directly as a superuser, and use of this option allows dumps to be made without violating the policy\&.
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
\fBPGHOST\fR, \fBPGOPTIONS\fR, \fBPGPORT\fR, \fBPGUSER\fR
.RS 4
Default connection parameters
.RE
.PP
This utility, like most other
PostgreSQL
utilities, also uses the environment variables supported by
libpq
(see
Section 31.13, \(lqEnvironment Variables\(rq, in the documentation)\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Since
pg_dumpall
calls
pg_dump
internally, some diagnostic messages will refer to
pg_dump\&.
.PP
Once restored, it is wise to run
ANALYZE
on each database so the optimizer has useful statistics\&. You can also run
vacuumdb \-a \-z
to analyze all databases\&.
.PP
pg_dumpall
requires all needed tablespace directories to exist before the restore; otherwise, database creation will fail for databases in non\-default locations\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To dump all databases:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_dumpall > db\&.out\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To reload database(s) from this file, you can use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpsql \-f db\&.out postgres\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
(It is not important to which database you connect here since the script file created by
pg_dumpall
will contain the appropriate commands to create and connect to the saved databases\&.)
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

\fBpg_dump\fR(1)
