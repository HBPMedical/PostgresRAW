.SH "NAME"
pg_dump \- extract a PostgreSQL database into a script file or other archive file
.\" pg_dump
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'pg_dump\ 'u
pg_dump [\fIconnection\-option\fR...] [\fIoption\fR...] [\fIdbname\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
pg_dump
is a utility for backing up a
PostgreSQL
database\&. It makes consistent backups even if the database is being used concurrently\&.
pg_dump
does not block other users accessing the database (readers or writers)\&.
.PP
Dumps can be output in script or archive file formats\&. Script dumps are plain\-text files containing the SQL commands required to reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time it was saved\&. To restore from such a script, feed it to
\fBpsql\fR(1)\&. Script files can be used to reconstruct the database even on other machines and other architectures; with some modifications, even on other SQL database products\&.
.PP
The alternative archive file formats must be used with
\fBpg_restore\fR(1)
to rebuild the database\&. They allow
pg_restore
to be selective about what is restored, or even to reorder the items prior to being restored\&. The archive file formats are designed to be portable across architectures\&.
.PP
When used with one of the archive file formats and combined with
pg_restore,
pg_dump
provides a flexible archival and transfer mechanism\&.
pg_dump
can be used to backup an entire database, then
pg_restore
can be used to examine the archive and/or select which parts of the database are to be restored\&. The most flexible output file format is the
\(lqcustom\(rq
format (\fB\-Fc\fR)\&. It allows for selection and reordering of all archived items, and is compressed by default\&. The
tar
format (\fB\-Ft\fR) is not compressed and has restrictions on reordering data when loading, but it is otherwise quite flexible; moreover, it can be manipulated with standard Unix tools such as
tar\&.
.PP
While running
pg_dump, one should examine the output for any warnings (printed on standard error), especially in light of the limitations listed below\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following command\-line options control the content and format of the output\&.
.PP
\fIdbname\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the name of the database to be dumped\&. If this is not specified, the environment variable
\fBPGDATABASE\fR
is used\&. If that is not set, the user name specified for the connection is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-data\-only\fR
.RS 4
Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions)\&.
.sp
This option is only meaningful for the plain\-text format\&. For the archive formats, you can specify the option when you call
pg_restore\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-blobs\fR
.RS 4
Include large objects in the dump\&. This is the default behavior except when
\fB\-\-schema\fR,
\fB\-\-table\fR, or
\fB\-\-schema\-only\fR
is specified, so the
\fB\-b\fR
switch is only useful to add large objects to selective dumps\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR
.RS 4
Output commands to clean (drop) database objects prior to (the commands for) creating them\&.
.sp
This option is only meaningful for the plain\-text format\&. For the archive formats, you can specify the option when you call
pg_restore\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-create\fR
.RS 4
Begin the output with a command to create the database itself and reconnect to the created database\&. (With a script of this form, it doesn\(aqt matter which database you connect to before running the script\&.)
.sp
This option is only meaningful for the plain\-text format\&. For the archive formats, you can specify the option when you call
pg_restore\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-E \fR\fB\fIencoding\fR\fR, \fB\-\-encoding=\fR\fB\fIencoding\fR\fR
.RS 4
Create the dump in the specified character set encoding\&. By default, the dump is created in the database encoding\&. (Another way to get the same result is to set the
\fBPGCLIENTENCODING\fR
environment variable to the desired dump encoding\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f \fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR, \fB\-\-file=\fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.RS 4
Send output to the specified file\&. If this is omitted, the standard output is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F \fR\fB\fIformat\fR\fR, \fB\-\-format=\fR\fB\fIformat\fR\fR
.RS 4
Selects the format of the output\&.
\fIformat\fR
can be one of the following:
.PP
p, plain
.RS 4
Output a plain\-text
SQL
script file (the default)\&.
.RE
.PP
c, custom
.RS 4
Output a custom\-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore\&. This is the most flexible output format in that it allows manual selection and reordering of archived items during restore\&. This format is also compressed by default\&.
.RE
.PP
t, tar
.RS 4
Output a
tar\-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore\&. This output format allows manual selection and reordering of archived items during restore, but there is a restriction: the relative order of table data items cannot be changed during restore\&. Also,
tar
format does not support compression and has a limit of 8 GB on the size of individual tables\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-version\fR
.RS 4
A deprecated option that is now ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n \fR\fB\fIschema\fR\fR, \fB\-\-schema=\fR\fB\fIschema\fR\fR
.RS 4
Dump only schemas matching
\fIschema\fR; this selects both the schema itself, and all its contained objects\&. When this option is not specified, all non\-system schemas in the target database will be dumped\&. Multiple schemas can be selected by writing multiple
\fB\-n\fR
switches\&. Also, the
\fIschema\fR
parameter is interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
psql\(aqs
\ed
commands (see
Patterns), so multiple schemas can also be selected by writing wildcard characters in the pattern\&. When using wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to prevent the shell from expanding the wildcards\&.

\fB\-N \fR\fB\fIschema\fR\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\-schema=\fR\fB\fIschema\fR\fR

Do not dump any schemas matching the

pattern\&. The pattern is interpreted according to the same rules as for
\fB\-n\fR\&.
\fB\-N\fR
can be given more than once to exclude schemas matching any of several patterns\&.
.sp
When both
\fB\-n\fR
and
\fB\-N\fR
are given, the behavior is to dump just the schemas that match at least one
\fB\-n\fR
switch but no
\fB\-N\fR
switches\&. If
\fB\-N\fR
appears without
\fB\-n\fR, then schemas matching
\fB\-N\fR
are excluded from what is otherwise a normal dump\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-oids\fR
.RS 4
Dump object identifiers (OIDs) as part of the data for every table\&. Use this option if your application references the
OID
columns in some way (e\&.g\&., in a foreign key constraint)\&. Otherwise, this option should not be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-no\-owner\fR
.RS 4
Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match the original database\&. By default,
pg_dump
issues
ALTER OWNER
or
SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
statements to set ownership of created database objects\&. These statements will fail when the script is run unless it is started by a superuser (or the same user that owns all of the objects in the script)\&. To make a script that can be restored by any user, but will give that user ownership of all the objects, specify
\fB\-O\fR\&.
.sp
This option is only meaningful for the plain\-text format\&. For the archive formats, you can specify the option when you call
pg_restore\&.

\fB\-S \fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR, \fB\-\-superuser=\fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling triggers\&. This is only relevant if
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
is used\&. (Usually, it\(aqs better to leave this out, and instead start the resulting script as superuser\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t \fR\fB\fItable\fR\fR, \fB\-\-table=\fR\fB\fItable\fR\fR
.RS 4
Dump only tables (or views or sequences) matching
\fItable\fR\&. Multiple tables can be selected by writing multiple
\fB\-t\fR
switches\&. Also, the
\fItable\fR
parameter is interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
psql\(aqs
\ed
commands (see

.sp
The
\fB\-n\fR
and
\fB\-N\fR
switches have no effect when
\fB\-t\fR
is used, because tables selected by
\fB\-t\fR
will be dumped regardless of those switches, and non\-table objects will not be dumped\&.

The behavior of the

switch is not entirely upward compatible with pre\-8\&.2
PostgreSQL
versions\&. Formerly, writing
\-t tab
would dump all tables named
tab, but now it just dumps whichever one is visible in your default search path\&. To get the old behavior you can write
\-t \(aq*\&.tab\(aq\&. Also, you must write something like
\-t sch\&.tab
to select a table in a particular schema, rather than the old locution of
\-n sch \-t tab\&.

\fB\-T\fR

Specify the compression level to use\&. Zero means no compression\&. For the custom archive format, this specifies compression of individual table\-data segments, and the default is to compress at a moderate level\&. For plain text output, setting a nonzero compression level causes the entire output file to be compressed, as though it had been fed through
gzip; but the default is not to compress\&. The tar archive format currently does not support compression at all\&.

Dump data as
INSERT
commands (rather than
COPY)\&. This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into non\-PostgreSQL
databases\&. However, since this option generates a separate command for each row, an error in reloading a row causes only that row to be lost rather than the entire table contents\&. Note that the restore might fail altogether if you have rearranged column order\&. The
\fB\-\-column\-inserts\fR
option is safe against column order changes, though even slower\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-column\-inserts\fR, \fB\-\-attribute\-inserts\fR
.RS 4
Dump data as
INSERT
commands with explicit column names (INSERT INTO \fItable\fR (\fIcolumn\fR, \&.\&.\&.) VALUES \&.\&.\&.)\&. This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into non\-PostgreSQL

This option disables the use of dollar quoting for function bodies, and forces them to be quoted using SQL standard string syntax\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
.RS 4
This option is only relevant when creating a data\-only dump\&. It instructs
pg_dump
to include commands to temporarily disable triggers on the target tables while the data is reloaded\&. Use this if you have referential integrity checks or other triggers on the tables that you do not want to invoke during data reload\&.
.sp
Presently, the commands emitted for
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
must be done as superuser\&. So, you should also specify a superuser name with
\fB\-S\fR, or preferably be careful to start the resulting script as a superuser\&.
.sp
This option is only meaningful for the plain\-text format\&. For the archive formats, you can specify the option when you call
pg_restore\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-lock\-wait\-timeout=\fR\fB\fItimeout\fR\fR
.RS 4
Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the beginning of the dump\&. Instead fail if unable to lock a table within the specified
\fItimeout\fR\&. The timeout may be specified in any of the formats accepted by
SET statement_timeout\&. (Allowed values vary depending on the server version you are dumping from, but an integer number of milliseconds is accepted by all versions since 7\&.3\&. This option is ignored when dumping from a pre\-7\&.3 server\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-tablespaces\fR
.RS 4
Do not output commands to select tablespaces\&. With this option, all objects will be created in whichever tablespace is the default during restore\&.

pg_restore\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-use\-set\-session\-authorization\fR
.RS 4
Output SQL\-standard
SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
commands instead of
ALTER OWNER
commands to determine object ownership\&. This makes the dump more standards\-compatible, but depending on the history of the objects in the dump, might not restore properly\&. Also, a dump using
SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
will certainly require superuser privileges to restore correctly, whereas
ALTER OWNER
requires lesser privileges\&.

Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running\&. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain socket\&. The default is taken from the
\fBPGHOST\fR
environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted\&.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-no\-password\fR
.RS 4
Never issue a password prompt\&. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a
\&.pgpass
file, the connection attempt will fail\&. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR
.RS 4
Force
pg_dump
to prompt for a password before connecting to a database\&.
.sp
This option is never essential, since
pg_dump
will automatically prompt for a password if the server demands password authentication\&. However,
pg_dump
will waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password\&. In some cases it is worth typing
\fB\-W\fR
to avoid the extra connection attempt\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-role=\fR\fB\fIrolename\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a role name to be used to create the dump\&. This option causes
pg_dump
to issue a
SET ROLE\fIrolename\fR
command after connecting to the database\&. It is useful when the authenticated user (specified by
\fB\-U\fR) lacks privileges needed by
pg_dump, but can switch to a role with the required rights\&. Some installations have a policy against logging in directly as a superuser, and use of this option allows dumps to be made without violating the policy\&.

utilities, also uses the environment variables supported by
libpq

Section 31.13, \(lqEnvironment Variables\(rq, in the documentation)\&.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
pg_dump
internally executes
SELECT
statements\&. If you have problems running
pg_dump, make sure you are able to select information from the database using, for example,
\fBpsql\fR(1)\&. Also, any default connection settings and environment variables used by the
libpq
front\-end library will apply\&.
.PP
The database activity of
pg_dump
is normally collected by the statistics collector\&. If this is undesirable, you can set parameter
track_counts
to false via
\fBPGOPTIONS\fR
or the
ALTER USER
command\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
If your database cluster has any local additions to the
template1
database, be careful to restore the output of
pg_dump
into a truly empty database; otherwise you are likely to get errors due to duplicate definitions of the added objects\&. To make an empty database without any local additions, copy from
template0
not
template1, for example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
CREATE DATABASE foo WITH TEMPLATE template0;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
When a data\-only dump is chosen and the option
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
is used,
pg_dump
emits commands to disable triggers on user tables before inserting the data, and then commands to re\-enable them after the data has been inserted\&. If the restore is stopped in the middle, the system catalogs might be left in the wrong state\&.
.PP
Members of tar archives are limited to a size less than 8 GB\&. (This is an inherent limitation of the tar file format\&.) Therefore this format cannot be used if the textual representation of any one table exceeds that size\&. The total size of a tar archive and any of the other output formats is not limited, except possibly by the operating system\&.
.PP
The dump file produced by
pg_dump
does not contain the statistics used by the optimizer to make query planning decisions\&. Therefore, it is wise to run
ANALYZE
after restoring from a dump file to ensure optimal performance; see
Section 23.1.3, \(lqUpdating Planner Statistics\(rq, in the documentation
and
Section 23.1.5, \(lqThe Autovacuum Daemon\(rq, in the documentation
for more information\&. The dump file also does not contain any
ALTER DATABASE \&.\&.\&. SET
commands; these settings are dumped by
\fBpg_dumpall\fR(1), along with database users and other installation\-wide settings\&.
.PP
Because
pg_dump
is used to transfer data to newer versions of
PostgreSQL, the output of
pg_dump
can be expected to load into
PostgreSQL
server versions newer than
pg_dump\(aqs version\&.
pg_dump
can also dump from
PostgreSQL
servers older than its own version\&. (Currently, servers back to version 7\&.0 are supported\&.) However,
pg_dump
cannot dump from
PostgreSQL
servers newer than its own major version; it will refuse to even try, rather than risk making an invalid dump\&. Also, it is not guaranteed that
pg_dump\(aqs output can be loaded into a server of an older major version \(em not even if the dump was taken from a server of that version\&. Loading a dump file into an older server may require manual editing of the dump file to remove syntax not understood by the older server\&.
