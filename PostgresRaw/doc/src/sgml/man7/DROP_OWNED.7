.SH "NOTES"
.PP
DROP OWNED
is often used to prepare for the removal of one or more roles\&. Because
DROP OWNED
only affects the objects in the current database, it is usually necessary to execute this command in each database that contains objects owned by a role that is to be removed\&.
.PP
Using the
CASCADE
option might make the command recurse to objects owned by other users\&.
.PP
The
REASSIGN OWNED (\fBREASSIGN_OWNED\fR(7))
command is an alternative that reassigns the ownership of all the database objects owned by one or more roles\&.
.PP
Databases owned by the role(s) will not be removed\&.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
The
DROP OWNED
statement is a
PostgreSQL
extension\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
