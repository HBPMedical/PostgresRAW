 *
 * prepqual.c
 *	  Routines for preprocessing qualification expressions
 *
 *
 * The parser regards AND and OR as purely binary operators, so a qual like
 *		(A = 1) OR (A = 2) OR (A = 3) ...
 * will produce a nested parsetree
 *		(OR (A = 1) (OR (A = 2) (OR (A = 3) ...)))
 * In reality, the optimizer and executor regard AND and OR as N-argument
 * operators, so this tree can be flattened to
 *		(OR (A = 1) (A = 2) (A = 3) ...)
 *
 * Formerly, this module was responsible for doing the initial flattening,
 * but now we leave it to eval_const_expressions to do that since it has to
 * make a complete pass over the expression tree anyway.  Instead, we just
 * have to ensure that our manipulations preserve AND/OR flatness.
 * pull_ands() and pull_ors() are used to maintain flatness of the AND/OR
 * tree after local transformations that might introduce nested AND/ORs.

 * actual usefulness, and so now the transformation doesn't involve any
