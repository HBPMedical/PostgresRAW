    is a standard method for ensuring data integrity.  A detailed
    description can be found in most (if not all) books about
    transaction processing. Briefly, <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>'s central
    concept is that changes to data files (where tables and indexes
    reside) must be written only after those changes have been logged,
    that is, after log records describing the changes have been flushed
    to permanent storage. If we follow this procedure, we do not need
    to flush data pages to disk on every transaction commit, because we
    know that in the event of a crash we will be able to recover the
    database using the log: any changes that have not been applied to
    the data pages can be redone from the log records.  (This is
    roll-forward recovery, also known as REDO.)

>Tip: </B
>     Because <ACRONYM

> restores database file
     contents after a crash, journaled file systems are not necessary for
     reliable storage of the data files or WAL files.  In fact, journaling
     overhead can reduce performance, especially if journaling
     causes file system <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>data</I
></SPAN
> to be flushed
     to disk.  Fortunately, data flushing during journaling can
     often be disabled with a file system mount option, e.g.
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>data=writeback</TT
> on a Linux ext3 file system.
     Journaled file systems do improve boot speed after a crash.

>    Using <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> results in a
    significantly reduced number of disk writes, because only the log
    file needs to be flushed to disk to guarantee that a transaction is
    committed, rather than every data file changed by the transaction.
    The log file is written sequentially,
    and so the cost of syncing the log is much less than the cost of
    flushing the data pages.  This is especially true for servers
    handling many small transactions touching different parts of the data
    store.  Furthermore, when the server is processing many small concurrent
    transactions, one <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>fsync</CODE
> of the log file may
    suffice to commit many transactions.

    backup and point-in-time recovery, as described in <A
HREF="continuous-archiving.html"
>Section 24.3</A
>.  By archiving the WAL data we can support
    reverting to any time instant covered by the available WAL data:
    we simply install a prior physical backup of the database, and
    replay the WAL log just as far as the desired time.  What's more,
    the physical backup doesn't have to be an instantaneous snapshot
    of the database state &mdash; if it is made over some period of time,
    then replaying the WAL log for that period will fix any internal
    inconsistencies.
