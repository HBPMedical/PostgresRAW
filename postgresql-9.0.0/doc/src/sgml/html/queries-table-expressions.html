    A table reference can be a table name (possibly schema-qualified),
    or a derived table such as a subquery, a table join, or complex
    combinations of these.  If more than one table reference is listed
    in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
> clause they are cross-joined (see below)
    to form the intermediate virtual table that can then be subject to
    transformations by the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>GROUP BY</TT
>,
    and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAVING</TT
> clauses and is finally the result of the
    overall table expression.
   </P
><P
>    When a table reference names a table that is the parent of a
    table inheritance hierarchy, the table reference produces rows of
    not only that table but all of its descendant tables, unless the
    key word <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ONLY</TT
> precedes the table name.  However, the
    reference produces only the columns that appear in the named table
    &mdash; any columns added in subtables are ignored.

     table by the original name elsewhere in the query.  Thus, this is not
     valid:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM people AS mother JOIN people AS child ON mother.id = child.mother_id;</PRE
><P>
     Additionally, an alias is required if the table reference is a

     To support this, the table function can be declared as returning
     the pseudotype <TT

     a query, the expected row structure must be specified in the
     query itself, so that the system can know how to parse and plan
     the query.  Consider this example:

     <TT

     The actual column set must be specified in the calling query so
     that the parser knows, for example, what <TT
