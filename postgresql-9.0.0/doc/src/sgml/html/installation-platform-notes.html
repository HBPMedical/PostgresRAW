     this is that attempts to use Unix-domain sockets with PostgreSQL
     lead to libpq overflowing the data structure.  TCP/IP connections

>15.8.1.4. Memory management</A
></H3
><P
>     AIX can be somewhat peculiar with regards to the way it does
     memory management.  You can have a server with many multiples of
     gigabytes of RAM free, but still get out of memory or address
     space errors when running applications.  One example
     is <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>createlang</TT
> failing with unusual errors.
     For example, running as the owner of the PostgreSQL installation:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>-bash-3.00$ createlang plperl template1
createlang: language installation failed: ERROR:  could not load library "/opt/dbs/pgsql748/lib/plperl.so": A memory address is not in the address space for the process.</PRE
><P>
    Running as a non-owner in the group possessing the PostgreSQL
    installation:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>-bash-3.00$ createlang plperl template1
createlang: language installation failed: ERROR:  could not load library "/opt/dbs/pgsql748/lib/plperl.so": Bad address</PRE
><P>
     Another example is out of memory errors in the PostgreSQL server
     logs, with every memory allocation near or greater than 256 MB
     failing.
    </P
><P
>     The overall cause of all these problems is the default bittedness
     and memory model used by the server process.  By default, all
     binaries built on AIX are 32-bit.  This does not depend upon
     hardware type or kernel in use.  These 32-bit processes are
     limited to 4 GB of memory laid out in 256 MB segments using one
     of a few models.  The default allows for less than 256 MB in the
     heap as it shares a single segment with the stack.
    </P
><P
>     In the case of the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>createlang</TT
> example, above,
     check your umask and the permissions of the binaries in your
     PostgreSQL installation.  The binaries involved in that example
     were 32-bit and installed as mode 750 instead of 755.  Due to the
     permissions being set in this fashion, only the owner or a member
     of the possessing group can load the library.  Since it isn't
     world-readable, the loader places the object into the process'
     heap instead of the shared library segments where it would
     otherwise be placed.
    </P
><P
>     The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ideal"</SPAN
> solution for this is to use a 64-bit
     build of PostgreSQL, but that is not always practical, because
     systems with 32-bit processors can build, but not run, 64-bit
     binaries.
    </P
><P
>     If a 32-bit binary is desired, set <TT
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>LDR_CNTRL</TT

     use of <TT
CLASS="SYMBOL"

     server to have <TT
CLASS="SYMBOL"

     heap, allocated in 256 MB segments.  When you find a workable
     configuration,
     <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ldedit</TT
> can be used to modify the binaries so
     that they default to using the desired heap size.  PostgreSQL can
     also be rebuilt, passing <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>configure
     LDFLAGS="-Wl,-bmaxdata:0x<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>n</I
></TT
>0000000"</TT

     to achieve the same effect.
    </P

>     For a 64-bit build, set <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>OBJECT_MODE</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"

>
     and <TT

>
     to <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xlc</TT
> might differ.)  If you omit the export of
    <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>OBJECT_MODE</TT
>, your build may fail with linker errors.  When
    <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>OBJECT_MODE</TT

    such as <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    type of objects to default to handling.
    </P
><P
>     By default, overcommit of paging space can happen.  While we have
     not seen this occur, AIX will kill processes when it runs out of
     memory and the overcommit is accessed.  The closest to this that
     we have seen is fork failing because the system decided that
     there was not enough memory for another process.  Like many other
     parts of AIX, the paging space allocation method and
     out-of-memory kill is configurable on a system- or process-wide
     basis if this becomes a problem.
