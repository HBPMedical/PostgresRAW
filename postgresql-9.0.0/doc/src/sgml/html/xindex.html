   section, we will illustrate this concept in an example: a new

   data type and index method.  By doing this, multiple
   sets of indexing semantics can be defined for a single data type.
   For example, a B-tree index requires a sort ordering to be defined
   for each data type it works on.
   It might be useful for a complex-number data type
   to have one B-tree operator class that sorts the data by complex
   absolute value, another that sorts by real part, and so on.
   Typically, one of the operator classes will be deemed most commonly
   useful and will be marked as the default operator class for that
   data type and index method.
  </P
><P
>   The same operator class name
   can be used for several different index methods (for example, both B-tree
   and hash index methods have operator classes named
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>int4_ops</TT

   entity and must be defined separately.

NAME="XINDEX-EXAMPLE"
>35.14.4. An Example</A

><P
>   Now that we have seen the ideas, here is the promised example of
   creating a new operator class.
   (You can find a working copy of this example in
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/tutorial/complex.c</TT
> and
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/tutorial/complex.sql</TT
> in the source
   distribution.)
   The operator class encapsulates
   operators that sort complex numbers in absolute value order, so we
   choose the name <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>complex_abs_ops</TT
>.  First, we need
   a set of operators.  The procedure for defining operators was
   discussed in <A
HREF="xoper.html"
>Section 35.12</A
>.  For an operator class on
   B-trees, the operators we require are:

   <P
></P
></P><UL
COMPACT="COMPACT"
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value less-than (strategy 1)</SPAN
></LI
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value less-than-or-equal (strategy 2)</SPAN
></LI
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value equal (strategy 3)</SPAN
></LI
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value greater-than-or-equal (strategy 4)</SPAN
></LI
><LI
><SPAN
>absolute-value greater-than (strategy 5)</SPAN
></LI
></UL
><P>
  </P
><P
>   The least error-prone way to define a related set of comparison operators
   is to write the B-tree comparison support function first, and then write the
   other functions as one-line wrappers around the support function.  This
   reduces the odds of getting inconsistent results for corner cases.
   Following this approach, we first write:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>#define Mag(c)  ((c)-&#62;x*(c)-&#62;x + (c)-&#62;y*(c)-&#62;y)

static int
complex_abs_cmp_internal(Complex *a, Complex *b)
{
    double      amag = Mag(a),
                bmag = Mag(b);

    if (amag &#60; bmag)
        return -1;
    if (amag &#62; bmag)
        return 1;
    return 0;
}</PRE
><P>

   Now the less-than function looks like:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(complex_abs_lt);

Datum
complex_abs_lt(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    Complex    *a = (Complex *) PG_GETARG_POINTER(0);
    Complex    *b = (Complex *) PG_GETARG_POINTER(1);

    PG_RETURN_BOOL(complex_abs_cmp_internal(a, b) &#60; 0);
}</PRE
><P>

   The other four functions differ only in how they compare the internal
   function's result to zero.
  </P
><P
>   Next we declare the functions and the operators based on the functions
   to SQL:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE FUNCTION complex_abs_lt(complex, complex) RETURNS bool
    AS '<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>filename</I
></TT
>', 'complex_abs_lt'
    LANGUAGE C IMMUTABLE STRICT;

CREATE OPERATOR &lt; (
   leftarg = complex, rightarg = complex, procedure = complex_abs_lt,
   commutator = &gt; , negator = &gt;= ,
   restrict = scalarltsel, join = scalarltjoinsel
);</PRE
><P>
   It is important to specify the correct commutator and negator operators,
   as well as suitable restriction and join selectivity
   functions, otherwise the optimizer will be unable to make effective
   use of the index.  Note that the less-than, equal, and
   greater-than cases should use different selectivity functions.
  </P
><P
>   Other things worth noting are happening here:

  <P
></P

><LI
><P
>     There can only be one operator named, say, <TT

     case we don't have any other operator <TT

></H2
><P
>   So far we have implicitly assumed that an operator class deals with
   only one data type.  While there certainly can be only one data type in
   a particular index column, it is often useful to index operations that
   compare an indexed column to a value of a different data type.  Also,
   if there is use for a cross-data-type operator in connection with an
   operator class, it is often the case that the other data type has a
   related operator class of its own.  It is helpful to make the connections
   between related classes explicit, because this can aid the planner in
   optimizing SQL queries (particularly for B-tree operator classes, since
   the planner contains a great deal of knowledge about how to work with them).

>   To handle these needs, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
   uses the concept of an <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>operator
   family</I
>.
   An operator family contains one or more operator classes, and can also
   contain indexable operators and corresponding support functions that
   belong to the family as a whole but not to any single class within the
   family.  We say that such operators and functions are <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loose"</SPAN
>
   within the family, as opposed to being bound into a specific class.
   Typically each operator class contains single-data-type operators
   while cross-data-type operators are loose in the family.
  </P
><P
>   All the operators and functions in an operator family must have compatible
   semantics, where the compatibility requirements are set by the index
   method.  You might therefore wonder why bother to single out particular
   subsets of the family as operator classes; and indeed for many purposes
   the class divisions are irrelevant and the family is the only interesting
   grouping.  The reason for defining operator classes is that they specify
   how much of the family is needed to support any particular index.
   If there is an index using an operator class, then that operator class
   cannot be dropped without dropping the index &mdash; but other parts of
   the operator family, namely other operator classes and loose operators,
   could be dropped.  Thus, an operator class should be specified to contain
   the minimum set of operators and functions that are reasonably needed
   to work with an index on a specific data type, and then related but
   non-essential operators can be added as loose members of the operator
   family.

><P
>   There are two special features of operator classes that we have
   not discussed yet, mainly because they are not useful
   with the most commonly used index methods.
  </P
><P
>   Normally, declaring an operator as a member of an operator class
   (or family) means that the index method can retrieve exactly the set of rows
   that satisfy a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> condition using the operator.  For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM table WHERE integer_column &lt; 4;</PRE
><P>
   can be satisfied exactly by a B-tree index on the integer column.
   But there are cases where an index is useful as an inexact guide to
   the matching rows.  For example, if a GiST index stores only bounding boxes
   for geometric objects, then it cannot exactly satisfy a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> 
   condition that tests overlap between nonrectangular objects such as
   polygons.  Yet we could use the index to find objects whose bounding
   box overlaps the bounding box of the target object, and then do the
   exact overlap test only on the objects found by the index.  If this
   scenario applies, the index is said to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"lossy"</SPAN
> for the
   operator.  Lossy index searches are implemented by having the index
   method return a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>recheck</I
> flag when a row might or might
   not really satisfy the query condition.  The core system will then
   test the original query condition on the retrieved row to see whether
   it should be returned as a valid match.  This approach works if
   the index is guaranteed to return all the required rows, plus perhaps
   some additional rows, which can be eliminated by performing the original
   operator invocation.  The index methods that support lossy searches
   (currently, GiST and GIN) allow the support functions of individual
   operator classes to set the recheck flag, and so this is essentially an
   operator-class feature.
  </P
><P
>   Consider again the situation where we are storing in the index only
   the bounding box of a complex object such as a polygon.  In this
   case there's not much value in storing the whole polygon in the index

   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

><P>

   At present, only the GiST and GIN index methods support a

   The GiST <CODE

   the <SPAN

   of the indexed column &mdash; for example, an operator class for
