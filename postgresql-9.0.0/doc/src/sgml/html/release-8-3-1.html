     </P
><P
>      This fix applies only on Windows and only when using UTF-8
      database encoding.  The same fix was made for all other cases
      over two years ago, but Windows with UTF-8 uses a separate code
      path that was not updated.  If you are using a locale that
      considers some non-identical strings as equal, you may need to
      <TT

>      A potential deadlock between concurrent <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

      operations on different system catalogs was introduced in 8.2.
      This has now been corrected.  8.3 made this worse because the
      deadlock could occur within a critical code section, making it
      a PANIC rather than just ERROR condition.
     </P

      vacuuming a system catalog could result in cache corruption in
