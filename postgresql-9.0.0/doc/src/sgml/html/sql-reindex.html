      data. Although in theory this should never happen, in
      practice indexes can become corrupted due to software bugs or
      hardware failures.  <TT

      recovery method.

>Notes</H2
><P
>   If you suspect corruption of an index on a user table, you can
   simply rebuild that index, or all indexes on the table, using
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX INDEX</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX TABLE</TT
>.
  </P
><P
>   Things are more difficult if you need to recover from corruption of
   an index on a system table.  In this case it's important for the
   system to not have used any of the suspect indexes itself.
   (Indeed, in this sort of scenario you might find that server
   processes are crashing immediately at start-up, due to reliance on
   the corrupted indexes.)  To recover safely, the server must be started
   with the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-P</TT
> option, which prevents it from using
   indexes for system catalog lookups.
  </P
><P
>   One way to do this is to shut down the server and start a single-user
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> server
   with the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-P</TT
> option included on its command line.
   Then, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX DATABASE</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX SYSTEM</TT
>,
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX TABLE</TT
>, or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX INDEX</TT
> can be
   issued, depending on how much you want to reconstruct.  If in
   doubt, use <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX SYSTEM</TT
> to select
   reconstruction of all system indexes in the database.  Then quit
   the single-user server session and restart the regular server.
   See the <A
HREF="app-postgres.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>postgres</SPAN
></A
> reference page for more
   information about how to interact with the single-user server
   interface.
  </P
><P
>   Alternatively, a regular server session can be started with
   <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-P</TT
> included in its command line options.
   The method for doing this varies across clients, but in all
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libpq</SPAN
>-based clients, it is possible to set
   the <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGOPTIONS</TT
> environment variable to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-P</TT
>
   before starting the client.  Note that while this method does not
   require locking out other clients, it might still be wise to prevent
   other users from connecting to the damaged database until repairs
   have been completed.
  </P
><P
>   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX</TT
> is similar to a drop and recreate of the index
   in that the index contents are rebuilt from scratch.  However, the locking
   considerations are rather different.  <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX</TT
> locks out writes
   but not reads of the index's parent table.  It also takes an exclusive lock
   on the specific index being processed, which will block reads that attempt
   to use that index.  In contrast, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP INDEX</TT
> momentarily takes
   exclusive lock on the parent table, blocking both writes and reads.  The
   subsequent <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX</TT
> locks out writes but not reads; since
   the index is not there, no read will attempt to use it, meaning that there
   will be no blocking but reads might be forced into expensive sequential
   scans.
  </P
><P
>   Reindexing a single index or table requires being the owner of that
   index or table.  Reindexing a database requires being the owner of
   the database (note that the owner can therefore rebuild indexes of
   tables owned by other users).  Of course, superusers can always
   reindex anything.
  </P
><P
>   Prior to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 8.1, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX
   DATABASE</TT
> processed only system indexes, not all indexes as one would
   expect from the name.  This has been changed to reduce the surprise
   factor.  The old behavior is available as <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX SYSTEM</TT
>.
  </P
><P
>   Prior to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 7.4, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REINDEX
   TABLE</TT
> did not automatically process TOAST tables, and so those had
   to be reindexed by separate commands.  This is still possible, but
   redundant.
