>    OIDs are 32-bit quantities and are assigned from a single
    cluster-wide counter.  In a large or long-lived database, it is
    possible for the counter to wrap around.  Hence, it is bad
    practice to assume that OIDs are unique, unless you take steps to
    ensure that this is the case.  If you need to identify the rows in
    a table, using a sequence generator is strongly recommended.
    However, OIDs can be used as well, provided that a few additional
    precautions are taken:

    <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>       A unique constraint should be created on the OID column of each
       table for which the OID will be used to identify rows.  When such
       a unique constraint (or unique index) exists, the system takes
       care not to generate an OID matching an already-existing row.
       (Of course, this is only possible if the table contains fewer
       than 2<SUP
>32</SUP
> (4 billion) rows, and in practice the
       table size had better be much less than that, or performance
       might suffer.)
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       OIDs should never be assumed to be unique across tables; use
       the combination of <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>tableoid</TT
> and row OID if you
       need a database-wide identifier.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Of course, the tables in question must be created <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH
       OIDS</TT

CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

       <TT

   </P
><P
>    Transaction identifiers are also 32-bit quantities.  In a
    long-lived database it is possible for transaction IDs to wrap
    around.  This is not a fatal problem given appropriate maintenance
    procedures; see <A
HREF="maintenance.html"
>Chapter 23</A
> for details.  It is
    unwise, however, to depend on the uniqueness of transaction IDs
    over the long term (more than one billion transactions).
   </P

    of 2<SUP

    within a single transaction.  In practice this limit is not a
    problem &mdash; note that the limit is on the number of

    Also, as of <SPAN

    that actually modify the database contents will consume a command
    identifier.
