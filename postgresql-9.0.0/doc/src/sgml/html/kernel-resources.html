>     The most important
    shared memory parameter is <TT

    bytes, of a shared memory segment. If you get an error message from
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>shmget</CODE
> like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Invalid argument"</SPAN
>, it is
    likely that this limit has been exceeded.  The size of the required
    shared memory segment varies depending on several
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> configuration parameters, as shown in
    <A
HREF="kernel-resources.html#SHARED-MEMORY-PARAMETERS"
>Table 17-2</A
>.  (Any error message you might
    get will include the exact size of the failed allocation request.)
    You can, as a temporary solution, lower some of those settings to
    avoid the failure.  While it is possible to get
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> to run with <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMMAX</TT
> as small as
    2 MB, you need considerably more for acceptable performance.  Desirable
    settings are in the hundreds of megabytes to a few gigabytes.
   </P
><P
>    Some systems also have a limit on the total amount of shared memory in
    the system (<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"

    for <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> plus any other applications that
    are using shared memory segments.  Note that <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMALL</TT
>
    is measured in pages rather than bytes on many systems.
   </P
><P
>    Less likely to cause problems is the minimum size for shared
    memory segments (<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMMIN</TT
>), which should be at most
    approximately 500 kB for <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> (it is
    usually just 1). The maximum number of segments system-wide
    (<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMMNI</TT
>) or per-process (<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMSEG</TT
>) are unlikely
    to cause a problem unless your system has them set to zero.
   </P
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> uses one semaphore per allowed connection
    (<A
HREF="runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS"
>max_connections</A
>) and allowed autovacuum worker
    process (<A
HREF="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-MAX-WORKERS"
>autovacuum_max_workers</A
>), in sets of 16.
    Each such set will
    also contain a 17th semaphore which contains a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"magic
    number"</SPAN
>, to detect collision with semaphore sets used by
    other applications. The maximum number of semaphores in the system
    is set by <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SEMMNS</TT
>, which consequently must be at least
    as high as <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_connections</TT
> plus
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>autovacuum_max_workers</TT
>, plus one extra for each 16
    allowed connections plus workers (see the formula in <A
HREF="kernel-resources.html#SYSVIPC-PARAMETERS"
>Table 17-1</A
>).  The parameter <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SEMMNI</TT
>
    determines the limit on the number of semaphore sets that can
    exist on the system at one time.  Hence this parameter must be at
    least <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ceil((max_connections + autovacuum_max_workers) / 16)</TT
>.
    Lowering the number
    of allowed connections is a temporary workaround for failures,
    which are usually confusingly worded <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"No space
    left on device"</SPAN
>, from the function <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>semget</CODE

    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SEMMAP</TT
> to be at least on the order of
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SEMMNS</TT
>. This parameter defines the size of the semaphore
    resource map, in which each contiguous block of available semaphores
    needs an entry. When a semaphore set is freed it is either added to
    an existing entry that is adjacent to the freed block or it is
    registered under a new map entry. If the map is full, the freed
    semaphores get lost (until reboot). Fragmentation of the semaphore
    space could over time lead to fewer available semaphores than there
    should be.
   </P

         mind that shared memory is not pageable; it is locked in RAM.
         To increase the amount of shared memory supported by your

         1024 represents 4 MB of shared memory. Therefore the above increases
         the maximum shared memory area to 32 MB.
         For those running 4.3 or later, you will probably also need to increase
         <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>KERNEL_VIRTUAL_MB</TT

    Although this setting will not prevent the <A

    altogether, it will lower the chances significantly and will therefore

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=2</PRE
><P>
    or placing an equivalent entry in <TT

    You might also wish to modify the related setting

    file <TT

   </P

>oom_adj</TT

    thereby guaranteeing it will not be targeted by the OOM killer.  The

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>echo -17 &#62; /proc/self/oom_adj</PRE
><P>
    in the postmaster's startup script just before invoking the postmaster.
    Note that this action must be done as root, or it will have no effect;
    so a root-owned startup script is the easiest place to do it.  If you
    do this, you may also wish to build <SPAN

    with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-DLINUX_OOM_ADJ=0</TT

    That will cause postmaster child processes to run with the normal
    <TT

    target them at need.
