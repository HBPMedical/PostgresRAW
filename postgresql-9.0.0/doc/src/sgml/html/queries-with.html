></H1
><P
>   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> provides a way to write subqueries for use in a larger
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT</TT
> query.  The subqueries can be thought of as defining
   temporary tables that exist just for this query.  One use of this feature
   is to break down complicated queries into simpler parts.  An example is:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH regional_sales AS (
        SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY region
     ), top_regions AS (
        SELECT region
        FROM regional_sales
        WHERE total_sales &gt; (SELECT SUM(total_sales)/10 FROM regional_sales)
     )
SELECT region,
       product,
       SUM(quantity) AS product_units,
       SUM(amount) AS product_sales
FROM orders
WHERE region IN (SELECT region FROM top_regions)
GROUP BY region, product;</PRE
><P>

   which displays per-product sales totals in only the top sales regions.
   This example could have been written without <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
>,
   but we'd have needed two levels of nested sub-SELECTs.  It's a bit
   easier to follow this way.
  </P
><P
>   The optional <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RECURSIVE</TT
> modifier changes <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
>
   from a mere syntactic convenience into a feature that accomplishes
   things not otherwise possible in standard SQL.  Using
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RECURSIVE</TT
>, a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query can refer to its own
   output.  A very simple example is this query to sum the integers from 1
   through 100:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
    VALUES (1)
  UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1 FROM t WHERE n &lt; 100
)
SELECT sum(n) FROM t;</PRE
><P>

   The general form of a recursive <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query is always a
   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>non-recursive term</I
>, then <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION</TT
> (or
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION ALL</TT
>), then a
   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>recursive term</I
>, where only the recursive term can contain
   a reference to the query's own output.  Such a query is executed as
   follows:

     rows in the result of the recursive query, and also place them in a
     temporary <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>working table</I
>.
    </P

       For <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION ALL</TT
>), discard
       duplicate rows and rows that duplicate any previous result row.
       Include all remaining rows in the result of the recursive query, and
       also place them in a temporary <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>intermediate table</I
>.
      </P
></LI
><LI
CLASS="STEP"
><P
>       Replace the contents of the working table with the contents of the
       intermediate table, then empty the intermediate table.

>   In the example above, the working table has just a single row in each step,
   and it takes on the values from 1 through 100 in successive steps.  In
   the 100th step, there is no output because of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT

   clause, and so the query terminates.
  </P
><P
>   Recursive queries are typically used to deal with hierarchical or
   tree-structured data.  A useful example is this query to find all the
   direct and indirect sub-parts of a product, given only a table that
   shows immediate inclusions:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE included_parts(sub_part, part, quantity) AS (
    SELECT sub_part, part, quantity FROM parts WHERE part = 'our_product'
  UNION ALL
    SELECT p.sub_part, p.part, p.quantity
    FROM included_parts pr, parts p
    WHERE p.part = pr.sub_part
  )
SELECT sub_part, SUM(quantity) as total_quantity
FROM included_parts
GROUP BY sub_part</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   When working with recursive queries it is important to be sure that
   the recursive part of the query will eventually return no tuples,
   or else the query will loop indefinitely.  Sometimes, using
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION</TT
> instead of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION ALL</TT
> can accomplish this
   by discarding rows that duplicate previous output rows.  However, often a
   cycle does not involve output rows that are completely duplicate: it may be
   necessary to check just one or a few fields to see if the same point has
   been reached before.  The standard method for handling such situations is
   to compute an array of the already-visited values.  For example, consider
   the following query that searches a table <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>graph</TT
> using a
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>link</TT
> field:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link
)
SELECT * FROM search_graph;</PRE
><P>

   This query will loop if the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>link</TT
> relationships contain
   cycles.  Because we require a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"depth"</SPAN
> output, just changing
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION ALL</TT
> to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION</TT
> would not eliminate the looping.
   Instead we need to recognize whether we have reached the same row again
   while following a particular path of links.  We add two columns
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>path</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>cycle</TT
> to the loop-prone query:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth, path, cycle) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1,
          ARRAY[g.id],
          false
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1,
          path || g.id,
          g.id = ANY(path)
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link AND NOT cycle
)
SELECT * FROM search_graph;</PRE
><P>

   Aside from preventing cycles, the array value is often useful in its own
   right as representing the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"path"</SPAN
> taken to reach any particular row.
  </P
><P
>   In the general case where more than one field needs to be checked to
   recognize a cycle, use an array of rows.  For example, if we needed to
   compare fields <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>f1</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>f2</TT
>:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth, path, cycle) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1,
          ARRAY[ROW(g.f1, g.f2)],
          false
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1,
          path || ROW(g.f1, g.f2),
          ROW(g.f1, g.f2) = ANY(path)
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link AND NOT cycle
)
SELECT * FROM search_graph;</PRE

>    The recursive query evaluation algorithm produces its output in
    breadth-first search order.  You can display the results in depth-first
    search order by making the outer query <TT

    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"path"</SPAN

>   A helpful trick for testing queries
   when you are not certain if they might loop is to place a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LIMIT</TT
>
   in the parent query.  For example, this query would loop forever without
   the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LIMIT</TT
>:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
    SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1 FROM t
)
SELECT n FROM t LIMIT 100;</PRE
><P>

   This works because <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>'s implementation
   evaluates only as many rows of a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query as are actually
   fetched by the parent query.  Using this trick in production is not
   recommended, because other systems might work differently.  Also, it
   usually won't work if you make the outer query sort the recursive query's
   results or join them to some other table.
  </P
><P
>   A useful property of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> queries is that they are evaluated
   only once per execution of the parent query, even if they are referred to
   more than once by the parent query or sibling <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> queries.
   Thus, expensive calculations that are needed in multiple places can be
   placed within a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query to avoid redundant work.  Another
   possible application is to prevent unwanted multiple evaluations of
   functions with side-effects.
   However, the other side of this coin is that the optimizer is less able to
   push restrictions from the parent query down into a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query
   than an ordinary sub-query.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query will generally be
   evaluated as stated, without suppression of rows that the parent query
   might discard afterwards.  (But, as mentioned above, evaluation might stop
   early if the reference(s) to the query demand only a limited number of
   rows.)
