>    To understand how the rule system works it is necessary to know
    when it is invoked and what its input and results are.</P
><P
>    The rule system is located between the parser and the planner.
    It takes the output of the parser, one query tree, and the user-defined
    rewrite rules, which are also
    query trees with some extra information, and creates zero or more
    query trees as result. So its input and output are always things
    the parser itself could have produced and thus, anything it sees
    is basically representable as an <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> statement.</P
><P
>    Now what is a query tree? It is an internal representation of an
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> statement where the single parts that it is
    built from are stored separately. These query trees can be shown
    in the server log if you set the configuration parameters
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>debug_print_parse</TT
>,
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>debug_print_rewritten</TT
>, or
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>debug_print_plan</TT
>.  The rule actions are also
    stored as query trees, in the system catalog
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_rewrite</TT
>.  They are not formatted like
    the log output, but they contain exactly the same information.</P
><P
>    Reading a raw query tree requires some experience.  But since
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> representations of query trees are
    sufficient to understand the rule system, this chapter will not
    teach how to read them.</P
><P
>    When reading the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> representations of the 
    query trees in this chapter it is necessary to be able to identify
    the parts the statement is broken into when it is in the query tree
    structure. The parts of a query tree are

        In the query tree, the range table entries are referenced by
        number rather than by name, so here it doesn't matter if there
        are duplicate names as it would in an <ACRONYM

        build the final output of the query.  They correspond to the

    </P
><P
>        <TT

        this is after the rule system and will be discussed later; for the
        rule system, the target list is empty.
    </P
><P
>        For <TT

        the new rows that should go into the result relation. It consists of the

> clause or the ones from the
        <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> clause in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT
        ... SELECT</TT

        target list entries for any columns that were not assigned to by
        the original command but have defaults.  Any remaining columns (with
        neither a given value nor a default) will be filled in by the
        planner with a constant null expression.
    </P
><P
>        For <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT

        describes the new rows that should replace the old ones. In the
        rule system, it contains just the expressions from the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SET
        column = expression</TT
> part of the command.  The planner will handle
        missing columns by inserting expressions that copy the values from
        the old row into the new one. And it will add the special
        <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CTID</ACRONYM

    </P
><P
>        Every entry in the target list contains an expression that can
        be a constant value, a variable pointing to a column of one
        of the relations in the range table, a parameter, or an expression
        tree made of function calls, constants, variables, operators, etc.

><DT

><DD
><P
>        The query's qualification is an expression much like one of
        those contained in the target list entries. The result value of
        this expression is a Boolean that tells whether the operation

        <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

        of an <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"

><DT
>the join tree</DT
><DD
><P
>        The query's join tree shows the structure of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
> clause.
        For a simple query like <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT ... FROM a, b, c</TT
>, the join tree is just
        a list of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
> items, because we are allowed to join them in
        any order.  But when <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JOIN</TT
> expressions, particularly outer joins,
        are used, we have to join in the order shown by the joins.
        In that case, the join tree shows the structure of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JOIN</TT
> expressions.  The
        restrictions associated with particular <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>JOIN</TT
> clauses (from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON</TT
> or
        <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USING</TT
> expressions) are stored as qualification expressions attached
        to those join-tree nodes.  It turns out to be convenient to store
        the top-level <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> expression as a qualification attached to the
        top-level join-tree item, too.  So really the join tree represents
        both the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clauses of a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
>.
    </P

><DT
>the others</DT
><DD
><P
>        The other parts of the query tree like the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
>
        clause aren't of interest here. The rule system
        substitutes some entries there while applying rules, but that
        doesn't have much to do with the fundamentals of the rule
        system.
