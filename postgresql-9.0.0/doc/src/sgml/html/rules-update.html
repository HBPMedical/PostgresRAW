    in mind.
    In the following, <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>update rules</I
> means rules that are defined
    on <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>, or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
>.</P
><P
>    Update rules get applied by the rule system when the result
    relation and the command type of a query tree are equal to the
    object and event given in the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE RULE</TT
> command.
    For update rules, the rule system creates a list of query trees.
    Initially the query-tree list is empty.
    There can be zero (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NOTHING</TT
> key word), one, or multiple actions.
    To simplify, we will look at a rule with one action. This rule
    can have a qualification or not and it can be <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</TT
> or
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALSO</TT
> (the default).</P
><P
>    What is a rule qualification? It is a restriction that tells
    when the actions of the rule should be done and when not. This
    qualification can only reference the pseudorelations <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW</TT
> and/or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OLD</TT
>,
    which basically represent the relation that was given as object (but with a
    special meaning).</P
><P
>    So we have three cases that produce the following query trees for
    a one-action rule.

    <P
></P
></P><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>No qualification, with either <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALSO</TT
> or
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</TT
></DT
><DD
><P
>        the query tree from the rule action with the original query
        tree's qualification added
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Qualification given and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALSO</TT
></DT
><DD
><P
>        the query tree from the rule action with the rule
        qualification and the original query tree's qualification
        added
       </P
></DD
><DT
>Qualification given and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</TT
></DT
><DD
><P
>        the query tree from the rule action with the rule
        qualification and the original query tree's qualification; and
        the original query tree with the negated rule qualification
        added
       </P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
><P>

    Finally, if the rule is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALSO</TT
>, the unchanged original query tree is
    added to the list. Since only qualified <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</TT
> rules already add the
    original query tree, we end up with either one or two output query trees
    for a rule with one action.</P
><P
>    For <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON INSERT</TT
> rules, the original query (if not suppressed by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</TT
>)
    is done before any actions added by rules.  This allows the actions to
    see the inserted row(s).  But for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON UPDATE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON
    DELETE</TT
> rules, the original query is done after the actions added by rules.
    This ensures that the actions can see the to-be-updated or to-be-deleted
    rows; otherwise, the actions might do nothing because they find no rows
    matching their qualifications.</P
><P
>    The query trees generated from rule actions are thrown into the
    rewrite system again, and maybe more rules get applied resulting
    in more or less query trees.
    So a rule's actions must have either a different
    command type or a different result relation than the rule itself is
    on, otherwise this recursive process will end up in an infinite loop.
    (Recursive expansion of a rule will be detected and reported as an
    error.)</P
><P
>    The query trees found in the actions of the
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_rewrite</TT
> system catalog are only
    templates. Since they can reference the range-table entries for
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OLD</TT
>, some substitutions have to be made before they can be
    used. For any reference to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW</TT
>, the target list of the original
    query is searched for a corresponding entry. If found, that
    entry's expression replaces the reference. Otherwise, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW</TT
> means the
    same as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OLD</TT
> (for an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>) or is replaced by
    a null value (for an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
>). Any reference to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OLD</TT
> is
    replaced by a reference to the range-table entry that is the
    result relation.</P
><P
>    After the system is done applying update rules, it applies view rules to the
    produced query tree(s).  Views cannot insert new update actions so
    there is no need to apply update rules to the output of view rewriting.</P

(1 row)</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    That's what we expected. What happened in the background is the following.
    The parser created the query tree:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE shoelace_data SET sl_avail = 6
  FROM shoelace_data shoelace_data
 WHERE shoelace_data.sl_name = 'sl7';</PRE
><P>

    There is a rule <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>log_shoelace</TT
> that is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ON UPDATE</TT
> with the rule
    qualification expression:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>NEW.sl_avail &lt;&gt; OLD.sl_avail</PRE
><P>

    and the action:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
       new.sl_name, new.sl_avail,
       current_user, current_timestamp )
  FROM shoelace_data new, shoelace_data old;</PRE
><P>

    (This looks a little strange since you cannot normally write
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT ... VALUES ... FROM</TT
>.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
>
    clause here is just to indicate that there are range-table entries
    in the query tree for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>new</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>old</TT
>.
    These are needed so that they can be referenced by variables in
    the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
> command's query tree.)</P
><P
>    The rule is a qualified <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALSO</TT
> rule, so the rule system
    has to return two query trees: the modified rule action and the original
    query tree. In step 1, the range table of the original query is
    incorporated into the rule's action query tree. This results in:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
       new.sl_name, new.sl_avail,
       current_user, current_timestamp )
  FROM shoelace_data new, shoelace_data old,
       <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shoelace_data shoelace_data</B
>;</PRE
><P>

    In step 2, the rule qualification is added to it, so the result set
    is restricted to rows where <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sl_avail</TT
> changes:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
       new.sl_name, new.sl_avail,
       current_user, current_timestamp )
  FROM shoelace_data new, shoelace_data old,
       shoelace_data shoelace_data
 <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>WHERE new.sl_avail &lt;&gt; old.sl_avail</B
>;</PRE
><P>

    (This looks even stranger, since <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT ... VALUES</TT
> doesn't have
    a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause either, but the planner and executor will have no
    difficulty with it.  They need to support this same functionality
    anyway for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT ... SELECT</TT
>.)
   </P
><P
>    In step 3, the original query tree's qualification is added,
    restricting the result set further to only the rows that would have been touched
    by the original query:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
       new.sl_name, new.sl_avail,
       current_user, current_timestamp )
  FROM shoelace_data new, shoelace_data old,
       shoelace_data shoelace_data
 WHERE new.sl_avail &lt;&gt; old.sl_avail
   <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>AND shoelace_data.sl_name = 'sl7'</B
>;</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    Step 4 replaces references to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW</TT
> by the target list entries from the
    original query tree or by the matching variable references
    from the result relation:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
       <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shoelace_data.sl_name</B
>, <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>6</B
>,
       current_user, current_timestamp )
  FROM shoelace_data new, shoelace_data old,
       shoelace_data shoelace_data
 WHERE <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>6</B
> &lt;&gt; old.sl_avail
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = 'sl7';</PRE
><P>

   </P
><P
>    Step 5 changes <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OLD</TT
> references into result relation references:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
       shoelace_data.sl_name, 6,
       current_user, current_timestamp )
  FROM shoelace_data new, shoelace_data old,
       shoelace_data shoelace_data
 WHERE 6 &lt;&gt; <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shoelace_data.sl_avail</B
>
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = 'sl7';</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    That's it.  Since the rule is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALSO</TT
>, we also output the
    original query tree.  In short, the output from the rule system
    is a list of two query trees that correspond to these statements:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
       shoelace_data.sl_name, 6,
       current_user, current_timestamp )
  FROM shoelace_data
 WHERE 6 &lt;&gt; shoelace_data.sl_avail
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = 'sl7';

UPDATE shoelace_data SET sl_avail = 6
 WHERE sl_name = 'sl7';</PRE
><P>

    These are executed in this order, and that is exactly what
    the rule was meant to do.
   </P
><P
>    The substitutions and the added qualifications
    ensure that, if the original query would be, say:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE shoelace_data SET sl_color = 'green'
 WHERE sl_name = 'sl7';</PRE
><P>

    no log entry would get written.  In that case, the original query
    tree does not contain a target list entry for
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sl_avail</TT
>, so <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEW.sl_avail</TT
> will get
    replaced by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace_data.sl_avail</TT
>.  Thus, the extra
    command generated by the rule is:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
       shoelace_data.sl_name, <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shoelace_data.sl_avail</B
>,
       current_user, current_timestamp )
  FROM shoelace_data
 WHERE <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shoelace_data.sl_avail</B
> &lt;&gt; shoelace_data.sl_avail
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = 'sl7';</PRE
><P>

    and that qualification will never be true.
   </P
><P
>    It will also work if the original query modifies multiple rows. So
    if someone issued the command:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE shoelace_data SET sl_avail = 0
 WHERE sl_color = 'black';</PRE
><P>

    four rows in fact get updated (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sl1</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sl2</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sl3</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sl4</TT
>).
    But <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sl3</TT
> already has <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sl_avail = 0</TT
>.   In this case, the original
    query trees qualification is different and that results
    in the extra query tree:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log
SELECT shoelace_data.sl_name, 0,
       current_user, current_timestamp
  FROM shoelace_data
 WHERE 0 &lt;&gt; shoelace_data.sl_avail
   AND <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>shoelace_data.sl_color = 'black'</B
>;</PRE
><P>

    being generated by the rule.  This query tree will surely insert
    three new log entries. And that's absolutely correct.</P
><P
>    Here we can see why it is important that the original query tree
    is executed last.  If the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> had been
    executed first, all the rows would have already been set to zero, so the
    logging <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
> would not find any row where
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0 &lt;&gt; shoelace_data.sl_avail</TT
>.</P

    )
    RETURNING
           shoelace_data.*,
           (SELECT shoelace_data.sl_len * u.un_fact
            FROM unit u WHERE shoelace_data.sl_unit = u.un_name);</PRE
><P>

    Note that this one rule supports both <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT

    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT RETURNING</TT

    <TT

   </P
><P
>    Now assume that once in a while, a pack of shoelaces arrives at
    the shop and a big parts list along with it.  But you don't want
    to manually update the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace</TT
> view every
    time.  Instead we setup two little tables: one where you can
    insert the items from the part list, and one with a special
    trick. The creation commands for these are:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLE shoelace_arrive (
    arr_name    text,
    arr_quant   integer
);

CREATE TABLE shoelace_ok (
    ok_name     text,
    ok_quant    integer
);

CREATE RULE shoelace_ok_ins AS ON INSERT TO shoelace_ok
    DO INSTEAD
    UPDATE shoelace
       SET sl_avail = sl_avail + NEW.ok_quant
     WHERE sl_name = NEW.ok_name;</PRE
><P>

    Now you can fill the table <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace_arrive</TT
> with
    the data from the parts list:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM shoelace_arrive;

 arr_name | arr_quant
----------+-----------
 sl3      |        10
 sl6      |        20
 sl8      |        20
(3 rows)</PRE
><P>

    Take a quick look at the current data:
    
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM shoelace;

 sl_name  | sl_avail | sl_color | sl_len | sl_unit | sl_len_cm

><P>

    Now move the arrived shoelaces in:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_ok SELECT * FROM shoelace_arrive;</PRE
><P>

    and check the results:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

><P>
   </P
><P
>    It's a long way from the one <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSERT ... SELECT</TT
>
    to these results. And the description of the query-tree
    transformation will be the last in this chapter.  First, there is
    the parser's output:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_ok
SELECT shoelace_arrive.arr_name, shoelace_arrive.arr_quant
  FROM shoelace_arrive shoelace_arrive, shoelace_ok shoelace_ok;</PRE
><P>

    Now the first rule <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace_ok_ins</TT
> is applied and turns this
    into:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE shoelace
   SET sl_avail = shoelace.sl_avail + shoelace_arrive.arr_quant
  FROM shoelace_arrive shoelace_arrive, shoelace_ok shoelace_ok,
       shoelace_ok old, shoelace_ok new,
       shoelace shoelace
 WHERE shoelace.sl_name = shoelace_arrive.arr_name;</PRE
><P>

    and throws away the original <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
> on
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace_ok</TT
>.  This rewritten query is passed to
    the rule system again, and the second applied rule
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace_upd</TT
> produces:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE shoelace_data
   SET sl_name = shoelace.sl_name,
       sl_avail = shoelace.sl_avail + shoelace_arrive.arr_quant,
       sl_color = shoelace.sl_color,
       sl_len = shoelace.sl_len,
       sl_unit = shoelace.sl_unit
  FROM shoelace_arrive shoelace_arrive, shoelace_ok shoelace_ok,
       shoelace_ok old, shoelace_ok new,
       shoelace shoelace, shoelace old,
       shoelace new, shoelace_data shoelace_data
 WHERE shoelace.sl_name = shoelace_arrive.arr_name
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = shoelace.sl_name;</PRE
><P>

    Again it's an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INSTEAD</TT
> rule and the previous query tree is trashed.
    Note that this query still uses the view <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace</TT
>.
    But the rule system isn't finished with this step, so it continues
    and applies the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_RETURN</TT
> rule on it, and we get:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>UPDATE shoelace_data
   SET sl_name = s.sl_name,
       sl_avail = s.sl_avail + shoelace_arrive.arr_quant,
       sl_color = s.sl_color,
       sl_len = s.sl_len,
       sl_unit = s.sl_unit
  FROM shoelace_arrive shoelace_arrive, shoelace_ok shoelace_ok,
       shoelace_ok old, shoelace_ok new,
       shoelace shoelace, shoelace old,
       shoelace new, shoelace_data shoelace_data,
       shoelace old, shoelace new,
       shoelace_data s, unit u
 WHERE s.sl_name = shoelace_arrive.arr_name
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = s.sl_name;</PRE
><P>

    Finally, the rule <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>log_shoelace</TT
> gets applied,
    producing the extra query tree:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log
SELECT s.sl_name,
       s.sl_avail + shoelace_arrive.arr_quant,
       current_user,
       current_timestamp
  FROM shoelace_arrive shoelace_arrive, shoelace_ok shoelace_ok,
       shoelace_ok old, shoelace_ok new,
       shoelace shoelace, shoelace old,
       shoelace new, shoelace_data shoelace_data,
       shoelace old, shoelace new,
       shoelace_data s, unit u,
       shoelace_data old, shoelace_data new
       shoelace_log shoelace_log
 WHERE s.sl_name = shoelace_arrive.arr_name
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = s.sl_name
   AND (s.sl_avail + shoelace_arrive.arr_quant) &lt;&gt; s.sl_avail;</PRE
><P>
    
    After that the rule system runs out of rules and returns the 
    generated query trees.
   </P
><P
>    So we end up with two final query trees that are equivalent to the
    <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> statements:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace_log
SELECT s.sl_name,
       s.sl_avail + shoelace_arrive.arr_quant,
       current_user,
       current_timestamp
  FROM shoelace_arrive shoelace_arrive, shoelace_data shoelace_data,
       shoelace_data s
 WHERE s.sl_name = shoelace_arrive.arr_name
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = s.sl_name
   AND s.sl_avail + shoelace_arrive.arr_quant &lt;&gt; s.sl_avail;
           
UPDATE shoelace_data
   SET sl_avail = shoelace_data.sl_avail + shoelace_arrive.arr_quant
  FROM shoelace_arrive shoelace_arrive,
       shoelace_data shoelace_data,
       shoelace_data s
 WHERE s.sl_name = shoelace_arrive.sl_name
   AND shoelace_data.sl_name = s.sl_name;</PRE
><P>

    The result is that data coming from one relation inserted into another,
    changed into updates on a third, changed into updating
    a fourth plus logging that final update in a fifth
    gets reduced into two queries.</P
><P
>    There is a little detail that's a bit ugly. Looking at the two
    queries, it turns out that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    definitely be reduced to one. The planner does not handle it and
    so the execution plan for the rule systems output of the
    <TT

    which produces exactly the same entries in the log table.  Thus,
    the rule system caused one extra scan on the table
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace_data</TT
> that is absolutely not
    necessary. And the same redundant scan is done once more in the

    that all possible at all.</P
><P

    Say you add some shoelaces with extraordinary colors to your
    database:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO shoelace VALUES ('sl9', 0, 'pink', 35.0, 'inch', 0.0);
INSERT INTO shoelace VALUES ('sl10', 1000, 'magenta', 40.0, 'inch', 0.0);</PRE
><P>

    We would like to make a view to check which
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>shoelace</TT
> entries do not fit any shoe in color.
    The view for this is:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE VIEW shoelace_mismatch AS
    SELECT * FROM shoelace WHERE NOT EXISTS
        (SELECT shoename FROM shoe WHERE slcolor = sl_color);</PRE
><P>

    Its output is:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM shoelace_mismatch;

 sl_name | sl_avail | sl_color | sl_len | sl_unit | sl_len_cm
---------+----------+----------+--------+---------+-----------
 sl9     |        0 | pink     |     35 | inch    |      88.9

><P>
   </P
><P
>    Now we want to set it up so that mismatching shoelaces that are
    not in stock are deleted from the database.
    To make it a little harder for <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    we don't delete it directly. Instead we create one more view:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE VIEW shoelace_can_delete AS
    SELECT * FROM shoelace_mismatch WHERE sl_avail = 0;</PRE
><P>

    and do it this way:
