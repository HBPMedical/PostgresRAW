      However, the background writer does cause a net overall
      increase in I/O load, because while a repeatedly-dirtied page might
      otherwise be written only once per checkpoint interval, the
      background writer might write it several times as it is dirtied
      in the same interval.  The parameters discussed in this subsection
      can be used to tune the behavior for local needs.

         <TT

         number of buffers that will be needed during the next round.  Dirty
         buffers are written until there are that many clean, reusable buffers

         buffers will be written per round.)
         Thus, a setting of 1.0 represents a <SPAN

         of writing exactly the number of buffers predicted to be needed.
         Larger values provide some cushion against spikes in demand,
         while smaller values intentionally leave writes to be done by
         server processes.
         The default is 2.0.
         This parameter can only be set in the <TT

         However, if the database is often busy with multiple queries issued in
