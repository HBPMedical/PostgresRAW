>   The regression tests can be run against an already installed and
   running server, or using a temporary installation within the build
   tree.  Furthermore, there is a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"parallel"</SPAN
> and a
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"sequential"</SPAN
> mode for running the tests.  The
   sequential method runs each test script alone, while the
   parallel method starts up multiple server processes to run groups
   of tests in parallel.  Parallel testing gives confidence that
   interprocess communication and locking are working correctly.
  </P
><P
>   To run the parallel regression tests after building but before installation,
   type:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake check</PRE
><P>
   in the top-level directory.  (Or you can change to
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/test/regress</TT
> and run the command there.)
   This will first build several auxiliary files, such as
   sample user-defined trigger functions, and then run the test driver
   script.  At the end you should see something like:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>=======================
 All 115 tests passed.
=======================</SAMP
></PRE
><P>
   or otherwise a note about which tests failed.  See <A
HREF="regress-evaluation.html"
>Section 30.2</A
> below before assuming that a
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"failure"</SPAN
> represents a serious problem.
  </P
><P
>    Because this test method runs a temporary server, it will not work
    when you are the root user (since the server will not start as root).
    If you already did the build as root, you do not have to start all
    over.  Instead, make the regression test directory writable by
    some other user, log in as that user, and restart the tests.
    For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>root# </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>chmod -R a+w src/test/regress</KBD
>
<SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>root# </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>su - joeuser</KBD
>
<SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>joeuser$ </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>cd <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>top-level build directory</I
></TT
></KBD
>
<SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>joeuser$ </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>gmake check</KBD
></PRE
><P>
    (The only possible <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"security risk"</SPAN
> here is that other
    users might be able to alter the regression test results behind
    your back.  Use common sense when managing user permissions.)
   </P
><P
>    Alternatively, run the tests after installation.
   </P
><P
>    If you have configured <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> to install
    into a location where an older <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
    installation already exists, and you perform <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gmake check</TT
>
    before installing the new version, you might find that the tests fail
    because the new programs try to use the already-installed shared
    libraries.  (Typical symptoms are complaints about undefined symbols.)
    If you wish to run the tests before overwriting the old installation,
    you'll need to build with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>configure --disable-rpath</TT
>.
    It is not recommended that you use this option for the final installation,
    however.
   </P
><P
>    The parallel regression test starts quite a few processes under your
    user ID.  Presently, the maximum concurrency is twenty parallel test
    scripts, which means forty processes: there's a server process and a
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
> process for each test script.
    So if your system enforces a per-user limit on the number of processes,
    make sure this limit is at least fifty or so, else you might get
    random-seeming failures in the parallel test.  If you are not in
    a position to raise the limit, you can cut down the degree of parallelism
    by setting the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>MAX_CONNECTIONS</TT
> parameter.  For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake MAX_CONNECTIONS=10 check</PRE
><P>
    runs no more than ten tests concurrently.
   </P
><P
>   To run the tests after installation (see <A
HREF="installation.html"
>Chapter 15</A
>),
   initialize a data area and start the
   server, as explained in <A
HREF="runtime.html"
>Chapter 17</A
>,  then type:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake installcheck</PRE
><P>
or for a parallel test:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake installcheck-parallel</PRE
><P>
   The tests will expect to contact the server at the local host and the
   default port number, unless directed otherwise by <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGHOST</TT
> and
   <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGPORT</TT
> environment variables.
  </P
><P
>   The source distribution also contains regression tests for the optional
   procedural languages and for some of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> modules.
   At present, these tests can be used only against an already-installed
   server.  To run the tests for all procedural languages that have been
   built and installed, change to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/pl</TT
> directory of the
   build tree and type:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake installcheck</PRE
><P>
   You can also do this in any of the subdirectories of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/pl</TT
>
   to run tests for just one procedural language.  To run the tests for all
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> modules that have them, change to the
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> directory of the build tree and type:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake installcheck</PRE
><P>
   The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> modules must have been built and installed first.
   You can also do this in a subdirectory of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> to run
   the tests for just one module.
  </P
><P
>   The source distribution also contains regression tests of the static
   behaviour of Hot Standby. These tests require a running primary server
   and a running standby server that is accepting new WAL changes from the
   primary using either file-based log shipping or streaming replication.
   Those servers are not automatically created for you, nor is the setup
   documented here. Please check the various sections of the docs already
   devoted to the required commands and related issues.
  </P
><P
>   First create a database called "regression" on the primary.
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>psql -h primary -c "CREATE DATABASE regression"</PRE
><P>
   Next, run a preparatory script on the primary in the regression database:
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/test/regress/sql/hs_primary_setup.sql</TT
>, and
   allow for the changes to propagate to the standby, for example
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>psql -h primary -f src/test/regress/sql/hs_primary_setup.sql regression</PRE
><P>
   Now confirm that the default connection for the tester is the standby
   server under test and then run the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>standbycheck</TT
> target from the regression
   directory:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>cd src/test/regress
gmake standbycheck</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   Some extreme behaviours can also be generated on the primary using the 
   script: <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/test/regress/sql/hs_primary_extremes.sql</TT
>
   to allow the behaviour of the standby to be tested.
  </P
><P
>   Additional automated testing may be available in later releases.
