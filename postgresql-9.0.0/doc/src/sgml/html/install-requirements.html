      The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>GNU</ACRONYM
> <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Readline</SPAN
> library is used by
      default.  It allows <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
> (the
      PostgreSQL command line SQL interpreter) to remember each
      command you type, and allows you to use arrow keys to recall and
      edit previous commands.  This is very helpful and is strongly
      recommended.  If you don't want to use it then you must specify
      the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--without-readline</TT
> option to
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
>. As an alternative, you can often use the
      BSD-licensed <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libedit</TT
> library, originally
      developed on <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>NetBSD</SPAN
>. The
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libedit</TT
> library is
      GNU <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Readline</SPAN
>-compatible and is used if
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libreadline</TT
> is not found, or if
      <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--with-libedit-preferred</TT
> is used as an
      option to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
>. If you are using a package-based
      Linux distribution, be aware that you need both the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>readline</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>readline-devel</TT
> packages, if
      those are separate in your distribution.

      The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>zlib</SPAN
> compression library is
      used by default. If you don't want to use it then you must
      specify the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--without-zlib</TT
> option to
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
>. Using this option disables
      support for compressed archives in <SPAN

      <SPAN
