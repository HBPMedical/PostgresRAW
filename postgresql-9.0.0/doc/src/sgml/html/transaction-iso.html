>    In <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>, you can request any of the
    four standard transaction isolation levels.  But internally, there are
    only two distinct isolation levels, which correspond to the levels Read
    Committed and Serializable.  When you select the level Read
    Uncommitted you really get Read Committed, and when you select
    Repeatable Read you really get Serializable, so the actual
    isolation level might be stricter than what you select.  This is
    permitted by the SQL standard: the four isolation levels only
    define which phenomena must not happen, they do not define which
    phenomena must happen.  The reason that <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
    only provides two isolation levels is that this is the only
    sensible way to map the standard isolation levels to the multiversion
    concurrency control architecture.  The behavior of the available
    isolation levels is detailed in the following subsections.
   </P

    level in <SPAN

    (without a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    committed before the query began; it never sees either uncommitted
    data or changes committed during query execution by concurrent
    transactions.  In effect, a <TT

    a snapshot of the database as of the instant the query begins to
    run.   However, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT

    of previous updates executed within its own transaction, even
    though they are not yet committed.  Also note that two successive

    in terms of searching for target rows: they will only find target rows
    that were committed as of the command start time.  However, such a target
    row might have already been updated (or deleted or locked) by
    another concurrent transaction by the time it is found.  In this case, the
    would-be updater will wait for the first updating transaction to commit or
    roll back (if it is still in progress).  If the first updater rolls back,
    then its effects are negated and the second updater can proceed with
    updating the originally found row.  If the first updater commits, the
    second updater will ignore the row if the first updater deleted it,
    otherwise it will attempt to apply its operation to the updated version of
    the row.  The search condition of the command (the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause) is
    re-evaluated to see if the updated version of the row still matches the
    search condition.  If so, the second updater proceeds with its operation
    using the updated version of the row.  In the case of
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT FOR UPDATE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT FOR
    SHARE</TT
>, this means it is the updated version of the row that is
    locked and returned to the client.
   </P
><P
>    Because of the above rule, it is possible for an updating command to see an
    inconsistent snapshot: it can see the effects of concurrent updating
    commands on the same rows it is trying to update, but it
    does not see effects of those commands on other rows in the database.
    This behavior makes Read Committed mode unsuitable for commands that
    involve complex search conditions; however, it is just right for simpler
    cases.  For example, consider updating bank balances with transactions
    like:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 12345;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 7534;
COMMIT;</PRE
><P>

    If two such transactions concurrently try to change the balance of account
    12345, we clearly want the second transaction to start with the updated
    version of the account's row.  Because each command is affecting only a
    predetermined row, letting it see the updated version of the row does
    not create any troublesome inconsistency.
   </P
><P
>    More complex usage can produce undesirable results in Read Committed
    mode.  For example, consider a <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
> command
    operating on data that is being both added and removed from its
    restriction criteria by another command, e.g., assume
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>website</TT
> is a two-row table with
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>website.hits</TT
> equaling <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>9</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>10</TT
>:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>BEGIN;
UPDATE website SET hits = hits + 1;
-- run from another session:  DELETE FROM website WHERE hits = 10;
COMMIT;</PRE
><P>

    The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
> will have no effect even though
    there is a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>website.hits = 10</TT
> row before and
    after the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>. This occurs because the
    pre-update row value <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>9</TT
> is skipped, and when the
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> completes and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
>
    obtains a lock, the new row value is no longer <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>10</TT
> but
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>11</TT
>, which no longer matches the criteria.
   </P
><P
>    Because Read Committed mode starts each command with a new snapshot
    that includes all transactions committed up to that instant,
    subsequent commands in the same transaction will see the effects
    of the committed concurrent transaction in any case.  The point

>    When an application receives this error message, it should abort
    the current transaction and retry the whole transaction from

    previously-committed change as part of its initial view of the database,
    so there is no logical conflict in using the new version of the row
    as the starting point for the new transaction's update.

    transaction sees a wholly consistent view of the database.  However,
    the application has to be prepared to retry transactions when concurrent
    updates make it impossible to sustain the illusion of serial execution.
    Since the cost of redoing complex transactions can be significant,
    serializable mode is recommended only when updating transactions contain logic
    sufficiently complex that they might give wrong answers in Read
    Committed mode.  Most commonly, Serializable mode is necessary when
    a transaction executes several successive commands that must see
    identical views of the database.

    Suppose that serializable transaction A computes:

    Such a locking system is complex to
    implement and extremely expensive in execution, since every session must
    be aware of the details of every query executed by every concurrent
    transaction.  And this large expense is mostly wasted, since in
    practice most applications do not do the sorts of things that could
    result in problems.  (Certainly the example above is rather contrived
    and unlikely to represent real software.)  For these reasons,
