>    Locale support is automatically initialized when a database
    cluster is created using <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
>.
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> will initialize the database cluster
    with the locale setting of its execution environment by default,
    so if your system is already set to use the locale that you want
    in your database cluster then there is nothing else you need to
    do.  If you want to use a different locale (or you are not sure
    which locale your system is set to), you can instruct
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> exactly which locale to use by
    specifying the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--locale</TT
> option. For example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>initdb --locale=sv_SE</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    This example for Unix systems sets the locale to Swedish
    (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sv</TT
>) as spoken
    in Sweden (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SE</TT
>).  Other possibilities might be
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>en_US</TT
> (U.S. English) and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fr_CA</TT
> (French
    Canadian).  If more than one character set can be used for a
    locale then the specifications can take the form
    <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>language_territory.codeset</I
></TT
>.  For example,
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fr_BE.UTF-8</TT
> represents the French language (fr) as
    spoken in Belgium (BE), with a <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>UTF-8</ACRONYM
> character set 
    encoding.
   </P
><P
>    What locales are available on your
    system under what names depends on what was provided by the operating
    system vendor and what was installed.  On most Unix systems, the command
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>locale -a</TT
> will provide a list of available locales.
    Windows uses more verbose locale names, such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>German_Germany</TT
>
    or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Swedish_Sweden.1252</TT
>, but the principles are the same.
   </P
><P
>    Occasionally it is useful to mix rules from several locales, e.g.,
    use English collation rules but Spanish messages.  To support that, a
    set of locale subcategories exist that control only certain
    aspects of the localization rules:

></DIV
>

    The category names translate into names of
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> options to override the locale choice
    for a specific category.  For instance, to set the locale to
    French Canadian, but use U.S. rules for formatting currency, use
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>initdb --locale=fr_CA --lc-monetary=en_US</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    If you want the system to behave as if it had no locale support,
    use the special locale <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>POSIX</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    Some locale categories must have their values
    fixed when the database is created.  You can use different settings
    for different databases, but once a database is created, you cannot
    change them for that database anymore. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LC_COLLATE</TT
>
    and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LC_CTYPE</TT
> are these type of categories.  They affect
    the sort order of indexes, so they must be kept fixed, or indexes on
    text columns would become corrupt.  The default values for these
    categories are determined when <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> is run, and
    those values are used when new databases are created, unless
    specified otherwise in the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE DATABASE</TT
> command.
   </P
><P
>    The other locale categories can be changed whenever desired
    by setting the server configuration parameters
    that have the same name as the locale categories (see <A
HREF="runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-FORMAT"
>Section 18.10.2</A
> for details).  The values
    that are chosen by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> are actually only written
    into the configuration file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> to
    serve as defaults when the server is started.  If you disable these
    assignments from <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> then the
    server will inherit the settings from its execution environment.
   </P
><P
>    Note that the locale behavior of the server is determined by the
    environment variables seen by the server, not by the environment
    of any client.  Therefore, be careful to configure the correct locale settings
    before starting the server.  A consequence of this is that if
    client and server are set up in different locales, messages might
    appear in different languages depending on where they originated.

>Note: </B
>     When we speak of inheriting the locale from the execution
     environment, this means the following on most operating systems:
     For a given locale category, say the collation, the following
     environment variables are consulted in this order until one is
     found to be set: <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LC_ALL</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LC_COLLATE</TT
>
     (or the variable corresponding to the respective category),
     <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LANG</TT
>.  If none of these environment variables are
     set then the locale defaults to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>     Some message localization libraries also look at the environment
     variable <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LANGUAGE</TT
> which overrides all other locale
     settings for the purpose of setting the language of messages.  If
     in doubt, please refer to the documentation of your operating
     system, in particular the documentation about
     <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>gettext</SPAN
