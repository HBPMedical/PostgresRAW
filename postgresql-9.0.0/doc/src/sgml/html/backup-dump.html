>   The idea behind this dump method is to generate a text file with SQL
   commands that, when fed back to the server, will recreate the
   database in the same state as it was at the time of the dump.
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> provides the utility program
   <A
HREF="app-pgdump.html"
>pg_dump</A

   command is:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SYNOPSIS"
>pg_dump <TT

   As you see, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> writes its result to the
   standard output. We will see below how this can be useful.
  </P
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> is a regular <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
   client application (albeit a particularly clever one). This means
   that you can perform this backup procedure from any remote host that has
   access to the database. But remember that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
>
   does not operate with special permissions. In particular, it must
   have read access to all tables that you want to back up, so in
   practice you almost always have to run it as a database superuser.
  </P
><P
>   To specify which database server <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> should
   contact, use the command line options <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-h
   <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>host</I
></TT
></TT
> and <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-p <TT

><I
>port</I
></TT
></TT
>. The
   default host is the local host or whatever your
   <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGHOST</TT
> environment variable specifies. Similarly,
   the default port is indicated by the <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGPORT</TT
>
   environment variable or, failing that, by the compiled-in default.
   (Conveniently, the server will normally have the same compiled-in
   default.)
  </P
><P
>   Like any other <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> client application,
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

   user name that is equal to the current operating system user name. To override
   this, either specify the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-U</TT
> option or set the
   environment variable <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGUSER</TT
>. Remember that
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> connections are subject to the normal
   client authentication mechanisms (which are described in <A
HREF="client-authentication.html"
>Chapter 19</A

  </P
><P
>   An important advantage of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN

   methods described later is that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
>'s output can
   generally be re-loaded into newer versions of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>,
   whereas file-level backups and continuous archiving are both extremely
   server-version-specific.  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> is also the only method
   that will work when transferring a database to a different machine
   architecture, such as going from a 32-bit to a 64-bit server.
  </P
><P
>   Dumps created by <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN

   meaning, the dump represents a snapshot of the database at the time
   <SPAN

> began running. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN
> does not
   block other operations on the database while it is working.
   (Exceptions are those operations that need to operate with an
   exclusive lock, such as most forms of <TT

    Either way, you will only have a partially restored database.
    Alternatively, you can specify that the whole dump should be
    restored as a single transaction, so the restore is either fully
    completed or fully rolled back. This mode can be specified by
    passing the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-1</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--single-transaction</TT
>
    command-line options to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN

    mode, be aware that even a minor error can rollback a
    restore that has already run for many hours. However, that might
    still be preferable to manually cleaning up a complex database
    after a partially restored dump.

    (Actually, you can specify any existing database name to start from,

    database superuser access when restoring a <SPAN

    If you use tablespaces, make sure that the tablespace paths in the
