>   Data types are a way to limit the kind of data that can be stored
   in a table.  For many applications, however, the constraint they
   provide is too coarse.  For example, a column containing a product
   price should probably only accept positive values.  But there is no
   standard data type that accepts only positive numbers.  Another issue is
   that you might want to constrain column data with respect to other
   columns or rows.  For example, in a table containing product
   information, there should be only one row for each product number.
  </P
><P
>   To that end, SQL allows you to define constraints on columns and
   tables.  Constraints give you as much control over the data in your
   tables as you wish.  If a user attempts to store data in a column
   that would violate a constraint, an error is raised.  This applies
   even if the value came from the default value definition.

></H2
><P
>    A check constraint is the most generic constraint type.  It allows
    you to specify that the value in a certain column must satisfy a
    Boolean (truth-value) expression.  For instance, to require positive
    product prices, you could use:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>CHECK (price &gt; 0)</B
>
);</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    As you see, the constraint definition comes after the data type,
    just like default value definitions.  Default values and
    constraints can be listed in any order.  A check constraint
    consists of the key word <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CHECK</TT
> followed by an
    expression in parentheses.  The check constraint expression should
    involve the column thus constrained, otherwise the constraint
    would not make too much sense.
   </P
><P
>    You can also give the constraint a separate name.  This clarifies
    error messages and allows you to refer to the constraint when you
    need to change it.  The syntax is:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric <B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>CONSTRAINT positive_price</B
> CHECK (price &gt; 0)
);</PRE
><P>
    So, to specify a named constraint, use the key word
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CONSTRAINT</TT
> followed by an identifier followed
    by the constraint definition.  (If you don't specify a constraint
    name in this way, the system chooses a name for you.)
   </P
><P
>    A check constraint can also refer to several columns.  Say you
    store a regular price and a discounted price, and you want to
    ensure that the discounted price is lower than the regular price:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

);</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    The first two constraints should look familiar.  The third one
    uses a new syntax.  It is not attached to a particular column,
    instead it appears as a separate item in the comma-separated
    column list.  Column definitions and these constraint
    definitions can be listed in mixed order.
   </P
><P
>    We say that the first two constraints are column constraints, whereas the
    third one is a table constraint because it is written separately
    from any one column definition.  Column constraints can also be
    written as table constraints, while the reverse is not necessarily
    possible, since a column constraint is supposed to refer to only the
    column it is attached to.  (<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    enforce that rule, but you should follow it if you want your table
    definitions to work with other database systems.)  The above example could

</P><PRE

    discounted_price numeric,

);</PRE

    It's a matter of taste.
   </P
><P

    column constraints:

   </P
><P
>    It should be noted that a check constraint is satisfied if the
    check expression evaluates to true or the null value.  Since most
    expressions will evaluate to the null value if any operand is null,
    they will not prevent null values in the constrained columns.  To
    ensure that a column does not contain null values, the not-null
    constraint described in the next section can be used.

    However, two null values are not considered equal in this
    comparison.  That means even in the presence of a
    unique constraint it is possible to store duplicate
    rows that contain a null value in at least one of the constrained
    columns.  This behavior conforms to the SQL standard, but we have
    heard that other SQL databases might not follow this rule.  So be
    careful when developing applications that are intended to be

    Let's also assume you have a table storing orders of those

   </P
><P
>    A table can contain more than one foreign key constraint.  This is
    used to implement many-to-many relationships between tables.  Say
    you have tables about products and orders, but now you want to
    allow one order to contain possibly many products (which the
    structure above did not allow).  You could use this table structure:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    price numeric

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id integer PRIMARY KEY,

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    product_no integer REFERENCES products,
    order_id integer REFERENCES orders,
    quantity integer,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_no, order_id)
);</PRE
><P>
    Notice that the primary key overlaps with the foreign keys in
    the last table.
   </P
><P
>    We know that the foreign keys disallow creation of orders that
    do not relate to any products.  But what if a product is removed
    after an order is created that references it?  SQL allows you to
    handle that as well.  Intuitively, we have a few options:
    <P

COMPACT="COMPACT"

><P

    These cause the referencing columns to be set to nulls or default
    values, respectively, when the referenced row is deleted.
    Note that these do not excuse you from observing any constraints.
    For example, if an action specifies <TT
