.SH "PARAMETERS"

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
REASSIGN OWNED
is often used to prepare for the removal of one or more roles\&. Because
REASSIGN OWNED
only affects the objects in the current database, it is usually necessary to execute this command in each database that contains objects owned by a role that is to be removed\&.
.PP
REASSIGN OWNED
requires privileges on both the source role(s) and the target role\&.
.PP
The
DROP OWNED (\fBDROP_OWNED\fR(7))
command is an alternative that drops all the database objects owned by one or more roles\&. Note also that
DROP OWNED
requires privileges only on the source role(s)\&.
.PP
The
REASSIGN OWNED
command does not affect the privileges granted to the old_roles in objects that are not owned by them\&. Use
DROP OWNED
to revoke those privileges\&.
.PP
The
REASSIGN OWNED
command does not affect the ownership of any databases owned by the role\&. Use
ALTER DATABASE (\fBALTER_DATABASE\fR(7))
to reassign that ownership\&.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
The
REASSIGN OWNED
statement is a
PostgreSQL
extension\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
DROP OWNED (\fBDROP_OWNED\fR(7)), DROP ROLE (\fBDROP_ROLE\fR(7)), ALTER DATABASE (\fBALTER_DATABASE\fR(7))
