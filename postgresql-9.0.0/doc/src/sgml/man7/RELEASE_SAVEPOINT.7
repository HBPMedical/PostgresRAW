.SH "NAME"
RELEASE_SAVEPOINT \- destroy a previously defined savepoint
.\" RELEASE SAVEPOINT
.\" savepoints: releasing
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
RELEASE [ SAVEPOINT ] \fIsavepoint_name\fR
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
RELEASE SAVEPOINT
destroys a savepoint previously defined in the current transaction\&.
.PP
Destroying a savepoint makes it unavailable as a rollback point, but it has no other user visible behavior\&. It does not undo the effects of commands executed after the savepoint was established\&. (To do that, see
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT (\fBROLLBACK_TO_SAVEPOINT\fR(7))\&.) Destroying a savepoint when it is no longer needed allows the system to reclaim some resources earlier than transaction end\&.
.PP
RELEASE SAVEPOINT
also destroys all savepoints that were established after the named savepoint was established\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fIsavepoint_name\fR
.RS 4
The name of the savepoint to destroy\&.
.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Specifying a savepoint name that was not previously defined is an error\&.
.PP
It is not possible to release a savepoint when the transaction is in an aborted state\&.
.PP
If multiple savepoints have the same name, only the one that was most recently defined is released\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To establish and later destroy a savepoint:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (3);
    SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (4);
    RELEASE SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
COMMIT;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The above transaction will insert both 3 and 4\&.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
This command conforms to the
SQL
standard\&. The standard specifies that the key word
SAVEPOINT
is mandatory, but
PostgreSQL
allows it to be omitted\&.
