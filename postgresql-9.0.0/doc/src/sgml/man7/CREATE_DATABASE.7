.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
CREATE DATABASE
creates a new
PostgreSQL
database\&.
.PP
To create a database, you must be a superuser or have the special
CREATEDB
privilege\&. See
CREATE USER (\fBCREATE_USER\fR(7))\&.
.PP
Normally, the creator becomes the owner of the new database\&. Superusers can create databases owned by other users, by using the
OWNER
clause\&. They can even create databases owned by users with no special privileges\&. Non\-superusers with
CREATEDB
privilege can only create databases owned by themselves\&.
.PP
By default, the new database will be created by cloning the standard system database
template1\&. A different template can be specified by writing
TEMPLATE \fIname\fR\&. In particular, by writing
TEMPLATE template0, you can create a virgin database containing only the standard objects predefined by your version of
PostgreSQL\&. This is useful if you wish to avoid copying any installation\-local objects that might have been added to
template1\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fIname\fR
.RS 4
The name of a database to create\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIuse_name\fR
.RS 4
The name of the database user who will own the new database, or
DEFAULT
to use the default (namely, the user executing the command)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fItemplate\fR
.RS 4
The name of the template from which to create the new database, or
DEFAULT
to use the default template (template1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIencoding\fR
.RS 4
Character set encoding to use in the new database\&. Specify a string constant (e\&.g\&.,
\(aqSQL_ASCII\(aq), or an integer encoding number, or
DEFAULT
to use the default encoding (namely, the encoding of the template database)\&. The character sets supported by the
PostgreSQL
server are described in
Section 22.2.1, \(lqSupported Character Sets\(rq, in the documentation\&. See below for additional restrictions\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIlc_collate\fR
.RS 4
Collation order (LC_COLLATE) to use in the new database\&. This affects the sort order applied to strings, e\&.g\&. in queries with ORDER BY, as well as the order used in indexes on text columns\&. The default is to use the collation order of the template database\&. See below for additional restrictions\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIlc_ctype\fR
.RS 4
Character classification (LC_CTYPE) to use in the new database\&. This affects the categorization of characters, e\&.g\&. lower, upper and digit\&. The default is to use the character classification of the template database\&. See below for additional restrictions\&.
.RE
.PP
\fItablespace\fR
.RS 4
The name of the tablespace that will be associated with the new database, or
DEFAULT
to use the template database\(aqs tablespace\&. This tablespace will be the default tablespace used for objects created in this database\&. See
CREATE TABLESPACE (\fBCREATE_TABLESPACE\fR(7))
for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIconnlimit\fR
.RS 4
How many concurrent connections can be made to this database\&. \-1 (the default) means no limit\&.
.RE
.PP
Optional parameters can be written in any order, not only the order illustrated above\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
CREATE DATABASE
cannot be executed inside a transaction block\&.
.PP
Errors along the line of
\(lqcould not initialize database directory\(rq
are most likely related to insufficient permissions on the data directory, a full disk, or other file system problems\&.
.PP
Use
DROP DATABASE (\fBDROP_DATABASE\fR(7))
to remove a database\&.
.PP
The program
\fBcreatedb\fR(1)
is a wrapper program around this command, provided for convenience\&.
.PP
Although it is possible to copy a database other than
template1
by specifying its name as the template, this is not (yet) intended as a general\-purpose
\(lqCOPY DATABASE\(rq
facility\&. The principal limitation is that no other sessions can be connected to the template database while it is being copied\&.
CREATE DATABASE
will fail if any other connection exists when it starts; otherwise, new connections to the template database are locked out until
CREATE DATABASE
completes\&. See
Section 21.3, \(lqTemplate Databases\(rq, in the documentation
for more information\&.
.PP
The character set encoding specified for the new database must be compatible with the chosen locale settings (LC_COLLATE
and
LC_CTYPE)\&. If the locale is
C
(or equivalently
POSIX), then all encodings are allowed, but for other locale settings there is only one encoding that will work properly\&. (On Windows, however, UTF\-8 encoding can be used with any locale\&.)
CREATE DATABASE
will allow superusers to specify
SQL_ASCII
encoding regardless of the locale settings, but this choice is deprecated and may result in misbehavior of character\-string functions if data that is not encoding\-compatible with the locale is stored in the database\&.
.PP
The encoding and locale settings must match those of the template database, except when
template0
is used as template\&. This is because other databases might contain data that does not match the specified encoding, or might contain indexes whose sort ordering is affected by
LC_COLLATE
and
LC_CTYPE\&. Copying such data would result in a database that is corrupt according to the new settings\&.
template0, however, is known to not contain any data or indexes that would be affected\&.
.PP
The
CONNECTION LIMIT
option is only enforced approximately; if two new sessions start at about the same time when just one connection
\(lqslot\(rq
remains for the database, it is possible that both will fail\&. Also, the limit is not enforced against superusers\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To create a new database:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
CREATE DATABASE lusiadas;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To create a database
sales
owned by user
salesapp
with a default tablespace of
salesspace:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
CREATE DATABASE sales OWNER salesapp TABLESPACE salesspace;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To create a database
music
which supports the ISO\-8859\-1 character set:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
CREATE DATABASE music ENCODING \(aqLATIN1\(aq TEMPLATE template0;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In this example, the
TEMPLATE template0
clause would only be required if
template1\(aqs encoding is not ISO\-8859\-1\&. Note that changing encoding might require selecting new
LC_COLLATE
and
LC_CTYPE
settings as well\&.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
There is no
CREATE DATABASE
statement in the SQL standard\&. Databases are equivalent to catalogs, whose creation is implementation\-defined\&.
