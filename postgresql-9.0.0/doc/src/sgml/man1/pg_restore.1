.SH "NAME"
pg_restore \- restore a PostgreSQL database from an archive file created by pg_dump
.\" pg_restore
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'pg_restore\ 'u
pg_restore [\fIconnection\-option\fR...] [\fIoption\fR...] [\fIfilename\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
pg_restore
is a utility for restoring a
PostgreSQL
database from an archive created by
\fBpg_dump\fR(1)
in one of the non\-plain\-text formats\&. It will issue the commands necessary to reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time it was saved\&. The archive files also allow
pg_restore
to be selective about what is restored, or even to reorder the items prior to being restored\&. The archive files are designed to be portable across architectures\&.
.PP
pg_restore
can operate in two modes\&. If a database name is specified,
pg_restore
connects to that database and restores archive contents directly into the database\&. Otherwise, a script containing the SQL commands necessary to rebuild the database is created and written to a file or standard output\&. This script output is equivalent to the plain text output format of
pg_dump\&. Some of the options controlling the output are therefore analogous to
pg_dump
options\&.
.PP
Obviously,
pg_restore
cannot restore information that is not present in the archive file\&. For instance, if the archive was made using the
\(lqdump data as INSERT commands\(rq
option,
pg_restore
will not be able to load the data using
COPY
statements\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
pg_restore
accepts the following command line arguments\&.
.PP
\fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the location of the archive file to be restored\&. If not specified, the standard input is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-data\-only\fR
.RS 4
Restore only the data, not the schema (data definitions)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR
.RS 4
Clean (drop) database objects before recreating them\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-create\fR
.RS 4
Create the database before restoring into it\&. (When this option is used, the database named with
\fB\-d\fR
is used only to issue the initial
CREATE DATABASE
command\&. All data is restored into the database name that appears in the archive\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d \fR\fB\fIdbname\fR\fR, \fB\-\-dbname=\fR\fB\fIdbname\fR\fR
.RS 4
Connect to database
\fIdbname\fR
and restore directly into the database\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exit\-on\-error\fR
.RS 4
Exit if an error is encountered while sending SQL commands to the database\&. The default is to continue and to display a count of errors at the end of the restoration\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f \fR\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR, \fB\-\-file=\fR\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify output file for generated script, or for the listing when used with
\fB\-l\fR\&. Default is the standard output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F \fR\fB\fIformat\fR\fR, \fB\-\-format=\fR\fB\fIformat\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify format of the archive\&. It is not necessary to specify the format, since
pg_restore
will determine the format automatically\&. If specified, it can be one of the following:
.PP
t, tar
.RS 4
The archive is a
tar
archive\&.
.RE
.PP
c, custom
.RS 4
The archive is in the custom format of
pg_dump\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-version\fR
.RS 4
A deprecated option that is now ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-I \fR\fB\fIindex\fR\fR, \fB\-\-index=\fR\fB\fIindex\fR\fR
.RS 4
Restore definition of named index only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-j \fR\fB\fInumber\-of\-jobs\fR\fR, \fB\-\-jobs=\fR\fB\fInumber\-of\-jobs\fR\fR
.RS 4
Run the most time\-consuming parts of
pg_restore
\(em those which load data, create indexes, or create constraints \(em using multiple concurrent jobs\&. This option can dramatically reduce the time to restore a large database to a server running on a multiprocessor machine\&.
.sp
Each job is one process or one thread, depending on the operating system, and uses a separate connection to the server\&.
.sp
The optimal value for this option depends on the hardware setup of the server, of the client, and of the network\&. Factors include the number of CPU cores and the disk setup\&. A good place to start is the number of CPU cores on the server, but values larger than that can also lead to faster restore times in many cases\&. Of course, values that are too high will lead to decreased performance because of thrashing\&.
.sp
Only the custom archive format is supported with this option\&. The input file must be a regular file (not, for example, a pipe)\&. This option is ignored when emitting a script rather than connecting directly to a database server\&. Also, multiple jobs cannot be used together with the option
\fB\-\-single\-transaction\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
.RS 4
List the contents of the archive\&. The output of this operation can be used as input to the
\fB\-L\fR
option\&. Note that if filtering switches such as
\fB\-n\fR
or
\fB\-t\fR
are used with
\fB\-l\fR, they will restrict the items listed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-L \fR\fB\fIlist\-file\fR\fR, \fB\-\-use\-list=\fR\fB\fIlist\-file\fR\fR
.RS 4
Restore only those archive elements that are listed in
\fIlist\-file\fR, and restore them in the order they appear in the file\&. Note that if filtering switches such as
\fB\-n\fR
or
\fB\-t\fR
are used with
\fB\-L\fR, they will further restrict the items restored\&.
.sp
\fIlist\-file\fR
is normally created by editing the output of a previous
\fB\-l\fR
operation\&. Lines can be moved or removed, and can also be commented out by placing a semicolon (;) at the start of the line\&. See below for examples\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n \fR\fB\fInamespace\fR\fR, \fB\-\-schema=\fR\fB\fIschema\fR\fR
.RS 4
Restore only objects that are in the named schema\&. This can be combined with the
\fB\-t\fR
option to restore just a specific table\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-no\-owner\fR
.RS 4
Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match the original database\&. By default,
pg_restore
issues
ALTER OWNER
or
SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
statements to set ownership of created schema elements\&. These statements will fail unless the initial connection to the database is made by a superuser (or the same user that owns all of the objects in the script)\&. With
\fB\-O\fR, any user name can be used for the initial connection, and this user will own all the created objects\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-tablespaces\fR
.RS 4
Do not output commands to select tablespaces\&. With this option, all objects will be created in whichever tablespace is the default during restore\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P \fR\fB\fIfunction\-name(argtype [, \&.\&.\&.])\fR\fR, \fB\-\-function=\fR\fB\fIfunction\-name(argtype [, \&.\&.\&.])\fR\fR
.RS 4
Restore the named function only\&. Be careful to spell the function name and arguments exactly as they appear in the dump file\(aqs table of contents\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-no\-reconnect\fR
.RS 4
This option is obsolete but still accepted for backwards compatibility\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-schema\-only\fR
.RS 4
Restore only the schema (data definitions), not the data (table contents)\&. Current sequence values will not be restored, either\&. (Do not confuse this with the
\fB\-\-schema\fR
option, which uses the word
\(lqschema\(rq
in a different meaning\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S \fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR, \fB\-\-superuser=\fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling triggers\&. This is only relevant if
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t \fR\fB\fItable\fR\fR, \fB\-\-table=\fR\fB\fItable\fR\fR
.RS 4
Restore definition and/or data of named table only\&. This can be combined with the
\fB\-n\fR
option to specify a schema\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-T \fR\fB\fItrigger\fR\fR, \fB\-\-trigger=\fR\fB\fItrigger\fR\fR
.RS 4
Restore named trigger only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Specifies verbose mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print the
pg_restore
version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-no\-privileges\fR, \fB\-\-no\-acl\fR
.RS 4
Prevent restoration of access privileges (grant/revoke commands)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
.RS 4
This option is only relevant when performing a data\-only restore\&. It instructs
pg_restore
to execute commands to temporarily disable triggers on the target tables while the data is reloaded\&. Use this if you have referential integrity checks or other triggers on the tables that you do not want to invoke during data reload\&.
.sp
Presently, the commands emitted for
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
must be done as superuser\&. So, you should also specify a superuser name with
\fB\-S\fR, or preferably run
pg_restore
as a
PostgreSQL
superuser\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-use\-set\-session\-authorization\fR
.RS 4
Output SQL\-standard
SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
commands instead of
ALTER OWNER
commands to determine object ownership\&. This makes the dump more standards\-compatible, but depending on the history of the objects in the dump, might not restore properly\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-data\-for\-failed\-tables\fR
.RS 4
By default, table data is restored even if the creation command for the table failed (e\&.g\&., because it already exists)\&. With this option, data for such a table is skipped\&. This behavior is useful if the target database already contains the desired table contents\&. For example, auxiliary tables for
PostgreSQL
extensions such as
PostGIS
might already be loaded in the target database; specifying this option prevents duplicate or obsolete data from being loaded into them\&.
.sp
This option is effective only when restoring directly into a database, not when producing SQL script output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-1\fR, \fB\-\-single\-transaction\fR
.RS 4
Execute the restore as a single transaction (that is, wrap the emitted commands in
BEGIN/COMMIT)\&. This ensures that either all the commands complete successfully, or no changes are applied\&. This option implies
\fB\-\-exit\-on\-error\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show help about
pg_restore
command line arguments, and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
pg_restore
also accepts the following command line arguments for connection parameters:
.PP
\fB\-h \fR\fB\fIhost\fR\fR, \fB\-\-host=\fR\fB\fIhost\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running\&. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain socket\&. The default is taken from the
\fBPGHOST\fR
environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR, \fB\-\-port=\fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is listening for connections\&. Defaults to the
\fBPGPORT\fR
environment variable, if set, or a compiled\-in default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-U \fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR, \fB\-\-username=\fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.RS 4
User name to connect as\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-no\-password\fR
.RS 4
Never issue a password prompt\&. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a
\&.pgpass
file, the connection attempt will fail\&. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR
.RS 4
Force
pg_restore
to prompt for a password before connecting to a database\&.
.sp
This option is never essential, since
pg_restore
will automatically prompt for a password if the server demands password authentication\&. However,
pg_restore
will waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password\&. In some cases it is worth typing
\fB\-W\fR
to avoid the extra connection attempt\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-role=\fR\fB\fIrolename\fR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a role name to be used to perform the restore\&. This option causes
pg_restore
to issue a
SET ROLE\fIrolename\fR
command after connecting to the database\&. It is useful when the authenticated user (specified by
\fB\-U\fR) lacks privileges needed by
pg_restore, but can switch to a role with the required rights\&. Some installations have a policy against logging in directly as a superuser, and use of this option allows restores to be performed without violating the policy\&.
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
\fBPGHOST\fR, \fBPGOPTIONS\fR, \fBPGPORT\fR, \fBPGUSER\fR
.RS 4
Default connection parameters
.RE
.PP
This utility, like most other
PostgreSQL
utilities, also uses the environment variables supported by
libpq
(see
Section 31.13, \(lqEnvironment Variables\(rq, in the documentation)\&.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
When a direct database connection is specified using the
\fB\-d\fR
option,
pg_restore
internally executes
SQL
statements\&. If you have problems running
pg_restore, make sure you are able to select information from the database using, for example,
\fBpsql\fR(1)\&. Also, any default connection settings and environment variables used by the
libpq
front\-end library will apply\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
If your installation has any local additions to the
template1
database, be careful to load the output of
pg_restore
into a truly empty database; otherwise you are likely to get errors due to duplicate definitions of the added objects\&. To make an empty database without any local additions, copy from
template0
not
template1, for example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
CREATE DATABASE foo WITH TEMPLATE template0;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The limitations of
pg_restore
are detailed below\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
When restoring data to a pre\-existing table and the option
\fB\-\-disable\-triggers\fR
is used,
pg_restore
emits commands to disable triggers on user tables before inserting the data, then emits commands to re\-enable them after the data has been inserted\&. If the restore is stopped in the middle, the system catalogs might be left in the wrong state\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
pg_restore
cannot restore large objects selectively; for instance, only those for a specific table\&. If an archive contains large objects, then all large objects will be restored, or none of them if they are excluded via
\fB\-L\fR,
\fB\-t\fR, or other options\&.
.RE
.PP
See also the
\fBpg_dump\fR(1)
documentation for details on limitations of
pg_dump\&.
.PP
Once restored, it is wise to run
ANALYZE
on each restored table so the optimizer has useful statistics; see
Section 23.1.3, \(lqUpdating Planner Statistics\(rq, in the documentation
and
Section 23.1.5, \(lqThe Autovacuum Daemon\(rq, in the documentation
for more information\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Assume we have dumped a database called
mydb
into a custom\-format dump file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_dump \-Fc mydb > db\&.dump\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To drop the database and recreate it from the dump:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBdropdb mydb\fR
$ \fBpg_restore \-C \-d postgres db\&.dump\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The database named in the
\fB\-d\fR
switch can be any database existing in the cluster;
pg_restore
only uses it to issue the
CREATE DATABASE
command for
mydb\&. With
\fB\-C\fR, data is always restored into the database name that appears in the dump file\&.
.PP
To reload the dump into a new database called
newdb:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBcreatedb \-T template0 newdb\fR
$ \fBpg_restore \-d newdb db\&.dump\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Notice we don\(aqt use
\fB\-C\fR, and instead connect directly to the database to be restored into\&. Also note that we clone the new database from
template0
not
template1, to ensure it is initially empty\&.
.PP
To reorder database items, it is first necessary to dump the table of contents of the archive:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBpg_restore \-l db\&.dump > db\&.list\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The listing file consists of a header and one line for each item, e\&.g\&.:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
