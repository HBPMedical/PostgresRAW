    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      PostgreSQL alpha releases are snapshots of development code. They
      are intended to preview and test upcoming features and to provide
      the possibility for early feedback. They should not be used in
      production installations or active development projects. While the
      PostgreSQL code is continuously subject to a number of automated
      and manual tests, alpha releases might have serious bugs. Also
      features may be changed incompatibly or removed at any time during
      the development cycle.
    </para>
    <para>
      The development cycle of a PostgreSQL major release alternates
      between periods of development and periods of integration work,
      called commit fests, normally one month each. Alpha releases are
      planned to be produced at the end of every commit fest, thus every
      two months. Since the first commit fest starts within a month from
      the beginning of development altogether, early alpha releases are
      not indicative of the likely feature set of the final release.
    </para>
    <para>
      The release notes below highlight user visible changes and new
      features. There are normally numerous bug fixes and performance
      improvements in every new snapshot of PostgreSQL, and it would be
      too bulky to attempt to list them all. Note that many bug fixes are
      also backported to stable releases of PostgreSQL, and you should be
      using those if you are looking for bug-fix-only upgrades for your
      current installations.
    </para>
    <para>
      The release notes are cumulative over all alpha releases.  Items
      that are new in the latest alpha release
      are <emphasis>emphasized</emphasis>.

    <title>Migration</title>
    <para>
      To upgrade from any release to an alpha release or from an alpha
      release to any other release will most likely require a
      dump/restore upgrade procedure. It may happen that this is not
      necessary in particular cases, but that is not verified beforehand.
      (The server will warn you in any case when a dump/restore is
      necessary if you attempt to use it with an old data directory.)
      Note, however, that the dump/restore upgrade procedure is expected
      to work for alpha releases, and problems in this area should be
      reported.
    </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Testing</title>
    <para>
      The primary reason we release alphas is to get users to test new
      features as early as possible.  If you are interested in helping
      with organized testing, please see

         <emphasis>Adjust naming of indexes and their columns. Index
         expression columns are now named after the FigureColname
         result for their expressions, rather than always being
         "pg_expression_N".  Digits are appended to this name if
         needed to make the column name unique within the index.
         Default names for indexes and associated constraints now
         include the column names of all their columns, not only the
         first one as in previous practice.</emphasis>

         <emphasis>Allow the index name to be omitted in CREATE INDEX,
         causing the system to choose an index name the same as it
         would do for an unnamed index constraint.  A necessary
         side-effect is to promote the word CONCURRENTLY to a more
         reserved status; it can't be a table/column/index name
         anymore unless quoted.</emphasis>

        <para>
         For BEFORE triggers this is mostly a matter of spec compliance; but
          for AFTER triggers it can provide a noticeable performance
          improvement, since queuing of a deferred trigger event and
          re-fetching of the row(s) at end of statement can be
          short-circuited if the trigger does not need to be fired.

         Add exclusion constraints, which generalize the concept of

          equality. Two rows violate the exclusion constraint if

          the constraint.

         Support ORDER BY within aggregate function calls, at long last

          values are fed to an aggregate function. At the same time eliminate
          the old implementation restriction that DISTINCT was only supported
          for single-argument aggregates.
        </para>
        <para>
         Behavioral change: formerly, agg(DISTINCT x) dropped null values of
          x unconditionally. Now, it does so only if the aggregate's transition
          function is strict; otherwise nulls are treated as DISTINCT
          normally would, i.e., you get one copy.

         A variable reference will only be recognized where it can validly

         When a name could refer either to a PL/pgSQL variable or a
          table column, PL/pgSQL formerly always assumed the variable was
          meant, sometimes resulting in surprising behavior.  Now, PL/pgSQL
          can assume the variable is meant, or assume the table column is
          meant, or throw an error in ambiguous cases.  For safety the default
          is to throw error.  To configure this see <link

         Note that this change affects the set of keywords that are
          reserved in PL/pgSQL (i.e., cannot be the name of a PL/pgSQL
          variable).  Now, all keywords shown as reserved in <link
          linkend="sql-keywords-appendix">Appendix C</link> are reserved for
          PL/pgSQL purposes as well.  However, many PL/pgSQL-only keywords
          that were formerly treated as reserved no longer are.  As in regular
          SQL, you can double-quote a variable's name if you want to use a
          name that conflicts with a reserved keyword.
